1)  There are far too many notations and some unclear words. The by far best and clearest is the abstract.

2)  "Majorization" is explained via "short map"
a notion extensively used only by you.  Say distance  non-incerasing or $1$-Lipschitz instead, everybody understands this.


3) $\delta _s$ goes to a different space than $\gamma$. I certainly understand what you mean, but if you introduce so many notations and
then they are not correct it is not good.   Possible suggestions: Fix $\gamma$ consider the set  $\mathcal phi _{\gamma}$ of all disc with the same restriction $\gamma $  of $S^1$.Introduce your
ordering in $\mathcal phi _{\gamma}$  and say that your objects are minimal with respect to this ordering.

Page 2

4) This is very improtant!    Say either before Theorem 1.1  or directly after it, what are examples of metric minimezers:

a) Every harmonic one, in particular every minimal one   (in the last very special case, your result is proved in my paper with Wenger and previously
"by formal calculations" by Mese),

b) Every ruled surface.
(In both cases provide 1-sentence of  explantions, possibly later in the main body of th text)


c)   Say that there are much more minimizers, at leats in the compact setting, since any given disc is "minorized", by compactess by a minimal one.


5) Say that  metric-minimality implies saddleness in R^n and more generally  (using convex functions) in $Y$.
Say that the converse seem natural, is closely related to Sheffel's work and is surprisingly difficult. Then  Propositon 1.2, then the rest.


Page 3

6)  Say something about notations and definitions. You may refer to some book, but something is needed in my opinion.
In particular:  "short map",  $B(x,\epsilon)_Y$.    also you use later "intrinsic metric" and "length metric".  Maybe, better to  stick to one of them.

Page 4

7)  The proof of Lemma 2.1 is too complicated   (I mean the formula $f^7-1} [ ... ]$ 
and misses the main point (in my eyes). I would just say, that

For any connected set $K\subset X$,  the diameter of $\pi _f (K)$ equals the diameter of $f(K)$.
When applied to connected neighborhoods, the continuity  of $f$ implies the continuity  of $\pi _f$.

Page 5

8)  In the second paragraph, you have  a map $f:X\to Y$, which does not belong to this Subsection.

9) The facts  that $\bar \pi_f$ has connected fibers and that $\bar f$ preserves  the length of any curve is not completely obvious
(say not less obvious than Lemma 2.1 and Lemma 2.2).    Indeed, the first claim is proven later in Lemma 2.3.


10) Second line in the proof of Lemma 2.2  "converging in itself" is very strange.


11)  I think it is "monotone" not "monotonic"

Page 6

12) Last paragrpah in the proof of  Lemma 2.3.
a) In the second line add $\subset \bar X$ after "$C$".
b) In the third line, I would add after "is connected"  the words "due to monotonicity of $\bar \pi _f$"
and delete the next sentence. Then directly "It follows ....".

=====================

On page 1 again:

1) You say never in the text that your "disc retract" really is a disc retract.
A suggestion:  define that a "disc retract" is a space homromorphic to a contractible subset of the disc.  Formulate the main theoremabout saying something about the boundary curve.
Add the statement after the theorem, that if the boundary of $s$ is  a simple closed curve
that your space is a disc.   At the beginning of Section 3,  give your definition fo a disc retract,
say that both defintions  are equivalent. Then state Propostion 3.1.

On pages 6,7

2) In Proposition 3.1 (or before it) say that $Y$ is an arbitary  metric space. 

3) Proof of 3.2, second line.  Replace "such that" by "with"

4) Proof of Lemma 3.3.  First word "From" not "form".
Third line "its boundary" instead of "it". I would  refer to some topological book for mapping cones,
in particular, since you do not say, what they are.


5)Important for me:    I do not understand the hocus-pocus  in the Proof of Propostion 3.1.
What happens with the following example:

Let $K$ be a cell-like set   in $D$  disjoint from the boundary  and intersecting every rectfiable curve in a set of length zero.  Set $Y=D /K$. and $f$ be the canonical projection.
Is it not correct, that $f$ is metric minimizing, that $<D>_f$ is $D$ and $Y =|D|_f$?

==================

The proof of Lemma 4.3 should be slightly rectified: the boundary curve needs not be injective, then  $X$ does not need to branch at a point of non-injectivity.  

The following should simplify and clarify the argument:  Discuss somewhere in the introduction or later that ruled surfaces are metric minimizing.  Then here you just say write $f$ as a limit of ruled discs, which is a ruled disc itself, hence metric minimizing ....


И еще вот что в голову пришло:

You could say in the introduction, that  the curvature of metric minimizing surfaces have already found several applications in NPC, in special cases:  my paper with Stephan,
and the paper of Stephan on Fary-Milnor (minimal discs), my old paper
"curvature of subsets of positive reach" and the paper of Alexanderr-Bishop 
"Gauss-Lemma ...."   (ruled surfaces).  

====================

1) English in the first and second sentence in section 5:
I think "analog" and "vertexes" is not quite correct.

2) The of metric minimizing graph is much clearer (and correcter) than the definition on the first page.

3) I have not realized it until now, so probably it will be unclear to most other 
potential readers as well: If you have a metric minimizing map, you can arbitrary change the parametrization by a homeomorphism. I would definitely make a comment somewhere.

4)  Second line of proof of Prop. 5.1:  either here (or if you prefer  in the definition of geodesics) one should assume that the parametrization  has constant speed. Otherwise you will not get a limiting map.

5)  Prop. 5.1 third paragraph. I think the term "well-ordered" is wrong.

6) You argument using filters and ultrafilters on general sets beyond $N$
is more sophisticated than needed Already usual ultrafilters are rather exotic.
What you consider there (without further comments) is probably unknown to almost everybody.    Suggestions:  Instead of the third paragraph and below, write something like  "By finiteness of the number of vertices  and Zorn's lemma,
it is sufficient to prove that for any ordered sequence of straight maps $f_1>f_2> ....>f_n >...$ there exists a map  $f$ with $f\leq f_n$ for all $n$."

Then more or less as before.

====================

a) Is it correct that in Proposition 6.1 you should add that the graph contains 
a geodesic between any pair of  points of $F$?

b)   Where in 6.2 doe you distinguish between points of $F$ on the boundary and in the interior?

====================

Chapter 7:  

1) I do not understand why you do not just use Tikhonov. This is much less obscure 
statement than  the notions of ultraconvergence.


2I think that  something very similar to Corollary 7.2 occurs in the paper  of Lang-Schroeder on Kirszbrauns theorem.

3) Should you decide to keep the proof you have to mention the place where you use something obscure (Zorn's lemma), namely on the top of page 13.


Chapter 8:

Is CAT(0) essential in Lemma 8.1? Should not it better be placed after 3.1 (since the same argument appears there).



First paragraph in the proof of the main theorem. 

a) Before you do reduction (maybe even in the beginning when you (should) discuss basic properties of metric minimizers you should say  something about restrictions to subdomains. Otherwise, I do not understand what you do.

b) You might also use  Lemma 3.1 from my paper with S.Wenger.

Chapter 9

It might be better to add  (considerably) more details, so that it could be understood.   Here are a few points:

a)  I am bad in such things, but I do not understand the picture.

b) Concerning properties of $E_v$:
  b1) Maybe say that it applies to Sobolev maps and refer also to Korevaar-Schoen?  Maybe not.

b3)  That is not quite obvious (at least for me). First there are regularity issues:
There might be a "smaller" $s'$ which is not Lipschitz. Moreover, you have not proved uniqueness, so there could exist a smaller disc, which differs only on a few curves.


c) What are asymptotic vectors?
