\begin{thm}{Extension lemma}\label{lem:finite-whole}
Suppose that $X$ is a set 
and $Y$ is a compact topological space.
Assume that for any finite set $F\subset X$ 
a nonempty set $\mathfrak{S}_F$ of maps  $F\to Y$ is given, such that
\begin{itemize}
\item $\mathfrak{S}_F$ is closed under pointwise convergence;
\item for any subset $F'\subset F$ and any map $h\in \mathfrak{S}_F$
the restriction $h|_{F'}$ belongs to $\mathfrak{S}_{F'}$. 
\end{itemize}

Then there is a map $h\: X\to Y$ such that $h|_F\in \mathfrak{S}_F$ for any finite set $F\subset X$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Consider the space $Y^X$ of all maps $X\to Y$ equipped with the product topology.

Denote by $\bar{\mathfrak{S}}_F$ the set of maps $h\in Y^X$ such that its restriction $h|_F$ belongs to $\mathfrak{S}_F$.
By assumption, the sets $\bar{\mathfrak{S}}_F\subset Y^X$ are closed and any finite interection of these sets is nonempty.

According to Tikhonov's theorem, $Y^X$ is compact.
By the finite intersection propery, the intersection $\bigcap_F\bar{\mathfrak{S}}_F$ for all finite sets $F\subset X$ is nonempty.
Hence the stattement follows.

Note that if $X$ and $Y$ are metric spaces and $A$ is a subset in $X$
then one can take as $\mathfrak{S}_F$ short maps $F\to Y$ which coincide with a given short map $A\to Y$ on $A\cap F$.
This way we obtain the folloing corollary; it is closely related to \cite[Proposition 5.2]{lang-shroeder}.
In a similar fashion, we will use the lemma in the proof of our main theorem.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces, $A\subset X$ and $f\:A\to Y$ a short map.
Assume $Y$ is compact and for any finite set $F\subset X$ there is a short map $F\to Y$ which agrees with $f$ in $F\cap A$.
Then there is a short map $X\to Y$ which agrees with $f$ in $A$.
\end{thm}
