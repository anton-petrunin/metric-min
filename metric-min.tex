\begin{abstract}
A surface which does not admit a length nonincreasing deformation is called \emph{metric minimizing}.
We show that reasonable metric minimizing surfaces in $\CAT[0]$ spaces are $\CAT[0]$ with respect to their intrinsic metric. 

\end{abstract}

\section{New introduction}

Let $Y$ be a metric space and $\gamma\:\SS^1\to Y$ is a closed rectifiable curve.

Assume that a map $s\:\DD\to Y$ \emph{spans} $\gamma$;
that is, the restriction of $s$ to $\SS^1=\partial\DD$ coincides with $\gamma$.
Consider the induced length pseudometric on $\DD$ defined as 
\[\|x-y\|_s=\inf_\alpha\{\length\alpha\},\]
where the exact upper bound is taken for all paths $\alpha$ from $x$ to $y$ in $\DD$.

The metric space which corresponds to $\DD$ equipped with the pseudometric  $\|{*}-{*}\|_s$ will be denoted by $\|\DD\|_s$, this space comes with the \emph{boundary curve} which is $\SS^1=\partial\DD$ under projection $\DD\to\|\DD\|_s$; the boundary curve will be denoted by $\delta_s$.

Assume $s$ and $s'$ are two maps spanning $\gamma$.
We write $s\succcurlyeq s'$ if there is a \emph{majorization}
$\iota\:\|\DD\|_s\to \|\DD\|_{s'}$;
that is, $\iota$ is a short map such that $\delta_{s'}=\iota\circ\delta_s$.

A spanning map $s$ is called metric minimizing if $s\succcurlyeq s'$ implies that the corresponding majorization is an isometry.
Intuitively, it means that one can not deform a  metric minimizing map keeping its values on the boundary and decreasing the induced metric.

\end{wrapfigure}

A metric space $W$ with a choice of closed curve $\delta\:\SS^1\to W$ is called \emph{disc retract} it the mapping cylinder of $\delta$ 
\[W_\delta=W\bigsqcup_{\delta(u)\sim(u,0)}\SS^1\times[0,1]\]
is homeomorphic to the disc $\DD$.
The curve $\delta$ will be called \emph{boundary curve} of the disc retract $W$.
Note that a disc retract (for example the one shown on the picture) may have essentially different boundary curves,
that is one is not a reparametrizationcan of the other.


\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Assume $Y$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space and $s\:\DD\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map.
Then $\|\DD\|_s$ is a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract with boundary curve $\delta_s$
\end{thm}


\section{Introduction}

%???\bar has too many meanings --- better use it only for one thing.

Assume $Y$ is a metric space, 
$\DD$ is the unit disc 
and $s\:\DD\to Y$ is a continuous map.
The induced intrinsic distance $\|x-y\|_s$ between the points $x,y\in\DD$ is defined in the preliminaries.
However, 
for reasonable%
\footnote{In particular if $s$ is a \emph{light map}; that is inverse image of any point is 0-dimensional.} 
maps $s$, 
the value $\|x-y\|_s$ coincides with the least upper bound for the lengths of $s\circ\gamma$ for all paths $\gamma\:[0,1]\to \DD$ which connect $x$ to $y$.
In particular, if $s$ is an embedding then $\|x-y\|_s$ coincides with the induced intrinsic metric between $s(x)$ and $s(y)$ in the image $s(\DD)\subset Y$.
The disc $\DD$ equipped with the metric $\|{*}-{*}\|_s$ will be denoted as $\|\DD\|_s$.

The map $s\:\DD\to Y$ is called \emph{metric minimizing relative its boundary} if for any other map $s'\:\DD\to Y$ which coincides with $s$ 
on the boundary $\partial \DD$, 
the intrinsic distance increases for at least two points of the domain.
Examples of metric minimizing surfaces include
ruled surfaces, energy minimizing and area minimizing surfaces; 
see Proposition~\ref{prop:harmonic}.
A general construction of metric minimizing maps is given in Proposition~\ref{prop:exist}.

\begin{thm}{Main theorem}\label{thm:mainintro}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space 
and $s\:\DD\to Y$ be a continuous metric minimizing map relative to the boundary $\partial\DD$.
Suppose that $\|\DD\|_s$  is separable. 
Then $\|\DD\|_s$ is $\CAT[0]$.

Moreover, 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item if $s|_{\partial\DD}$ is rectifiable then $\|\DD\|_s$ is homeomorphic to a disc retract
and $s$ uniquely determined by $s|_{\partial\DD}$ and the metric $\|{*}-{*}\|_s$;
\item if in addition $s|_{\partial\DD}$ is an embedding, then $\|\DD\|_s$ is homeomorphic to the disc.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}

A weaker vesion of the above theorem was proved by the first author in \cite{petrunin-metric-min};
this proof also contained a gap which we fill in this paper.

The theorem generalizes Alexandrov's theorem on ruled surfaces \cite{A};
it is also closely related to the resuls of Shefel in \cite{shefel-2D} and \cite{shefel-3D}. 
Any metric minimizing surface in a $\CAT[0]$ space is saddle 
in the sense that an intersection with a convex set can not cut a hat from the surface;
see Section~\ref{Shefel}.
The converse does not hold even for smooth surfaces in $\RR^3$, see the example in Section~\ref{sec:smooth}.
In \cite{petrunin-metric-min} it was asked if all saddle surfaces are locally metric minimizing.
We prove it in the following partial case; 
see Proposition~\ref{prop:smooth} below. 

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Any smooth strictly saddle surface in $\RR^3$ is locally metric minimizing. 
\end{thm}

We suspect that an analogous statement in 4-dimensional Euclidean space does not hold;
see the last section for more details.

For applications of our result see \cite{LSW} and \cite{St}.

\parbf{Structure of the paper.}
In Section~\ref{sec:Def} we give the necessary definitions from metric geometry, introduce the concept of metric minimizing map
and in Section~\ref{Metric minimizing maps} and prove its basic properties including uniqueness. 

In Section~\ref{Metric minimizing graphs}
we discuss metric minimizing graphs and show that any metric minimizing graph can be extended to a short
map defined on a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract (Corollary \ref{cor:planar-minimizing-graph}). 
In Section~\ref{Metric minimizing discs} we study metric minimizing discs and use a theorem of Moore \cite{moore} to obtain 
topological information about  their associated \emph{connecting metric space} (Proposition \ref{prop:|D|}). 
This result is responsible for 
the topological control in the main theorems;
this is the main missing part in \cite{petrunin-metric-min}. 

In the sections~\ref{Key Lemma}--\ref{Shefel} we prepare geometrical statements for the proof of the main theorem.
In Section~\ref{Key Lemma} we prove the key lemma (\ref{lem:key}) which implies that metric minimizing discs factorize through 
two-dimensional $\CAT[0]$-spaces. 
Section~\ref{Compactness} provides a compactness result for $\CAT[0]$-surfaces;
this theorem might be of independent interest. 
In Section~\ref{Shefel} we treat the two-dimensional case; 
that is, metric minimizing discs in $\CAT[0]$-surfaces;
this part is a straightforward generalization of Shefel's result from \cite{shefel-2D}. 

In Section~\ref{Main theorem} we assemble the proof our main theorem (\ref{thm:main}) and its corollary (\ref{cor:main}) 
which includes most of the statements in Theorem~\ref{thm:mainintro} above; the uniqueness part follow from theorem \ref{prop:strict-mm} 
proved earlier.

Sections \ref{Harmonic discs}--\ref{sec:smooth} are about examples.
In Section~\ref{Harmonic discs} we recall some results about  harmonic discs and show that they imply that any harmonic disc is metric minimizing. 
In Section~\ref{sec:smooth} we treat smooth saddle surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and show that they are locally metric minimizing.
This turned out to be rather tricky.

Finally in Section~\ref{Final remarks} we comment on the separability condition and on saddle 
surfaces in general.

\section{Preliminary definitions}\label{sec:Def}

\parbf{Pseudometrics.}
Let $X$ be a set.
A \emph{pseudometric} on a set $X$ 
is a function $X\times X\to[0,\infty]$ denoted as $(x,y)\mapsto |x-y|$
such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $|x-x|=0$, for any $x\in X$;
\item $|x-y|=|y-x|$, for any $x,y\in X$;
\item $|x-y|+|y-z|\ge|x-z|$ for any  $x,y,z\in X$.
\end{itemize}
If in addition $|x-y|=0$ implies $x=y$ then the pseudometric $|{*}-{*}|$ is called \emph{nondegenerated};
some authors call it \emph{$\infty$-metric space}.
A nondegenerated pseudometric which only takes finite values is called a \emph{metric}. 
A set with a pseudometric or metric will be called \emph{pseudometric} or correspondingly \emph{metric space}.

The value $|x-y|$ will also be called \emph{distance} form $x$ to $y$.
Note that by our definition, the distance between points might be infinite.

For any pseudometric on a set there is an equivalence relation ``$\sim$'' such that 
\[x\sim y\quad\iff\quad|x-y|=0.\]
The pseudometric induced  on the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$ is nondegenerated.

Further, for a nondegenerated pseudometric space we can consider the equivalence relation ``$\approx$'' defined as 
\[x\approx y\quad\iff\quad|x-y|<\infty.\]
Its equivalence classes are called \emph{metric components}.
Note that by definition each metric component is a \emph{metric space}.
Consequently, a nondegenerated pseudometric space can be thought of as a disjoint union of \emph{metric spaces}.
We will say that the obtained metric spaces are \emph{defined} by the  original pseudometric space.

\parbf{Connecting pseudometric.}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces.
Given a map $f\:X\to Y$,
define a \emph{connecting pseudometric} $|{*}-{*}|_f$ on $X$ in
the following way
\[|x-y|_f=\inf\{\diam f(K)\},\]
where the infimum is taken over all connected sets $K\subset X$ which contain $x$ and $y$;
if there is no such set we set $|x-y|_f=\infty$. 

The associated non-degenerated pseudometric space will be
denoted as $|X|_f$ and we denote by $\bar\pi_f\:X\to |X|_f$ the natural projection map.
The map $f$ factors as $f=\bar f\circ \bar\pi_f$ with $\bar\pi_f\:X\to|X|_f$ and $\bar f\:|X|_f\to Y$.
For a point $x\in X$, let $[x]_f=\bar\pi_f^{-1}(\bar\pi_f(x))$ be the \emph{fiber} of $\bar\pi_f$ thru $x$.

If $X$ is compact (which will be always the case)
then the constructed decomposition $f=\bar f\circ \bar\pi_f$ is so called monotonic-light decomposition --- the map $\bar\pi_f$ is \emph{monotonic}
in the sense that inverse image of each point is connected (see the corollary \ref{cor:fiberconnected} below)
and $\bar f$ is \emph{light}; 
that is the inverse image of any point has dimension $0$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:picont}
Let $X$ be a length space, $Y$ be a metric space and $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map. 
Then the following holds true.
\begin{itemize}
\item $\bar\pi_f\:X\to|X|_f$ is continuous.

 \item For points $x,y\in X$ with $|x-y|_f<\infty$ we have
\[|x-y|_f=\inf\{\diam f(K)\},\]
where the infimum is taken over all {\em open} connected sets $K\subset X$ which contain $x$ and $y$.

\item $|X|_f$ is locally pathconnected.
\end{itemize}

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $(x_k)$ be a sequence in $X$ which converges to a point $x$. 
Given $\eps>0$ choose $\delta>0$ such that $f(B_\delta(x))\subset B_\eps(f(x))$. 
If $x_k\in B_\delta(x)$, then there is a path in $X$ connecting $x_k$ to $x$ whose image under $f$ has diameter less than $2\cdot\eps$ and therefore $|x-x_k|_f\to 0$. 
This shows the first claim.

Let $C$ be a connected subset of $Y$ with finite diameter. 
Then for every $\eps>0$ the open $\eps$-neighbourhood $U_\eps$ of $C$ has diameter less than $\diam C+2\cdot\eps$. 
The claim follows since every component of the inverse image $f^{-1}(U_\eps)$ is open. 

Let $x$ be a point in $|X|_f$ and $y\in B_r(x)$ for some $r>0$. 
Let $\hat x,\hat y\in X$ be arbitrary lifts of $x$ and $y$.
From above we know that there is an open connected subset $C$ in $X$ containing $\hat x$ and $\hat y$ and such that 
$\diam f(C)<r$. 
Since $X$ is a length space, we can join $\hat x$ and $\hat y$ by a path in $C$.
Hence the last statement follows.
\qeds

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{cor:fiberconnected}
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map between metric spaces.
Assume $X$ is compact. 
Then for every point $x\in X$ the fiber $[x]_f$ is connected;
in other words, the map $\bar\pi_f\:X\to |X|_f$ is monotonic.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary;
that is, a fiber $[x]_f$ can be covered by disjoint open sets $U,V\subset X$ such that each intersection 
$[x]_f\cap U$ and $[x]_f\cap V$ are nonempty.

We can assume that $x\in [x]_f\cap U$.
Pick $y\in [x]_f\cap V$.
Then there is a sequence of connected sets $K_n\ni p,q$ such that $\diam f(K)<\tfrac1n$.
For each $n$ pick a point $k_n\in K_n\backslash (U\cup V)$ and let $k$ be its partial limit.
It follows that $k\in [x]_f\backslash (U\cup V)$, a contradiction.
\qeds

\parbf{Intrinisic pseudometric.}
For a metric space $X$ and a curve $\gamma\:[a,b]\to X$ we define its {\em length} as
\[\length\gamma=\sup\sum_{i=0}^{k-1} |\gamma(t_i)-\gamma(t_{i+1})|\]
where the supremum is taken over all finite partitions ${a=t_0<t_1<\ldots t_k=b}$ of $[a,b]$. 
A curve $\gamma$ is called {\em rectifiable} if its length is finite.

The intrinsic metric defined by $|{*}-{*}|_f$ will be denoted by 
$\|{*}-{*}\|_f$. 
That~is, 
\[\|x-y\|_f
=
\inf
\set{\length\gamma}{\gamma\ \text{is a path in}\ |X|_f\ \text{from}\ \bar\pi_f(x) \ \text{to}\ \bar\pi_f(y)}\]
where the length is computed with respect to $|{*}-{*}|_f$. 

Accordingly the associated nondegenerated  pseudometric space defined by $\|{*}-{*}\|_f$ on $X$ 
is denoted by $\|X\|_f$. 
Note that by definition, each metric component of $\|X\|_f$ is a length space.

   (1) edge[bend right] node[below right]{$\bar{\bar\pi}_f$}(11);
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}

We will denote by $\iota_f\:|X|_f\zz\to \|X\|_f$ the natural map between the spaces;
note that $\iota$ is bijective and has a continuous inverse.
Set 
\[
\bar{\bar f}=\iota_f\circ\bar f
\quad\text{and}\quad
\bar{\bar\pi}_f=\bar\pi_f\circ\iota_f^{-1}.
\]


Note that  $\bar f$
is length preserving;
that is,
\[\length(\bar f\circ\gamma)=\length\gamma\]
for any path $\gamma\:[0,1]\to |X|_f$.
The same holds for  $\iota_f\:|X|_f\zz\to \|X\|_f$ and $\bar{\bar f}\:\|X\|_f\to Y$.

Recall that a map between topological spaces is called monotone if the inverse image of any point is connected.
Note that by the definition, any monotone map is onto.
Note that if $f\:X\to Y$ is monotonic then $\|X\|_f$ is isometric to $Y$
and the isometry induced by the quotient map $[x]_f\mapsto f(x)$.

The following lemma essentially says that completeness survives under passing to the intrinsic metric
and the intrinsic metric on compact spaces is always geodesic.
While the second statement is a classical (see for example \cite[II-\S8 Thm. 3]{KF}), 
we were not be able to find the first one in the literature.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:geospace}
Let $X$ be a compact %geodesic IS NOT NEEDED 
space, $Y$ a metric space and $f\:X\to Y$ a continuous map. 
Then each metric component of $\|X\|_f$ is a complete geodesic space.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
From Lemma \ref{lem:picont} we know that $\bar\pi_f$ is continuous and therefore $|X|_f$ is compact.

Fix a sequence $(x_n)$ in $\|X\|_f$ converging in itself, but not converging in $\|X\|_f$.
After passing to a subsequence, we can assume that the points of the sequence appear on a rectifiable curve $\gamma\:[0,1)\to\|X\|_f$ in the same order.

The corresponding curve $\bar\gamma\:[0,1)\to |X|_f$ has the same length.
Since $|X|_f$ is compact we can extend it to a path $\bar\gamma_+\:[0,1]\to |X|_f$.
Again, its projection $\gamma_+\:[0,1]\to\|X\|_f$ has the same length.
Therefore $\gamma_+(1)$ is the limit of $(x_n)$, a contradiction.

Assume $\gamma_n$ is a sequence of constant speed paths from $x$ to $y$ in $|X|_f$
such that $\length\gamma_n\to \|x-y\|_f$.
Since $|X|_f$ is compact, we can pass to its partial limit $\gamma$.
Clearly $\gamma$ is a geodesic from $x$ to $y$ for the metric $\|x-y\|_f$.

%\begin{thm}{Lifting Lemma}\label{lem:lift}
%Let $X$ be a compact geodesic space, $Y$ a metric space and $f\:X\to Y$ a continuous map. 
%Let $c\:[0,1]\to|X|_f$ be a rectifiable path joining points $p$ and $q$ in $|X|_f$. 
%Suppose that $\hat p$ and $\hat q$ are lifts of the points $p$ an $q$ to $X$.
%Then for every $\eps>0$ there exists a piecewise geodesic path $\hat c\:[0,1]\to X$ joining $\hat p$ to $\hat q$ such that 
%\[|\bar\pi_f\circ\hat c(t)-c(t)|_f<\eps\ \text{for all}\ t\in[0,1].\]
%\end{thm}

%\parit{Proof.}
%Since $\|X\|_f$ is a geodesic space, 
%by Lemma \ref{lem:geospace} it is enough to consider the case where $c$ is a geodesic.
%Given $\eps>0$ denote $U_\eps$ the open $\eps$-neighborhood of $c([0,1])$ and choose times %$0=t_0<t_1<\ldots<t_k=1$ 
%such that $|c(t_i)-c(t_{i+1})|_f<\frac{\eps}{2}$. 
%Choose arbitrary lifts $\hat c(t_i)$ of the points $c(t_i)$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots,k-1\}$.
%By Lemma \ref{lem:picont}, we find open connected sets $C_i\subset X$ containing $\hat c(t_i)$ and $\hat c(t_{i+1})$ with $\diam f(C_i)<\eps$. 
%In particular $\bar\pi_f(C_i)\subset U_\eps$. 
%To finish the proof we join $\hat c(t_i)$ and $\hat c(t_{i+1})$ by piecewise geodesics in $C_i$.

%\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:connecedpreimage}
%Let $X$ be a compact geodesic space, $Y$ a metric space and $f\:X\to Y$ a continuous map. 
%Then the inverse image under $\bar\pi_f$ of an open connected subset $C$ of $|X|_f$  is pathconnected in $X$.
%\end{thm}

%\parit{Proof.}
%Let $C$ be an open connected subset of $|X|_f$. 
%By Lemma \ref{lem:picont}, $|X|_f$ is locally pathconnected and therefore $C$ is pathconnected. 
%Hence the claim follows from the Lifting Lemma \ref{lem:lift}.

%\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:idem}
%Let $X$ be a compact geodesic space, $Y$ a metric spaces and $f\:X\to Y$ a continuous map.
%Then for any map $s\:|X|_f\to Y$ holds
%\[|X|_{s\circ\bar\pi_f}\cong||X|_{f}|_s.\]
%In particular $|X|_{f}\cong||X|_{f}|_{\bar f}$. %???what is \bar f???
%\end{thm}

%\parit{Proof.}
%Since $\bar\pi_f$ is continuous, by Lemma \ref{lem:picont}, we see $|\bar\pi_f(x)-\bar\pi_f(y)|_s=0$ if $|x-y|_{s\circ\bar\pi_f}=0$. 
%Moreover, $\bar\pi_f$ induces a surjective short map $\alpha\:|X|_{s\circ\bar\pi_f}\to||X|_{f}|_s$. 
%From Corollary \ref{cor:connecedpreimage} it follows that $\alpha$ is an isometry.
%\qeds

\parbf{On an alternative definitions.}
Let us discuss an alternative definition of induced length metric denoted as $\llangle {*}-{*}\rrangle_f$.
It will not used in the paper.
We include it to explain why we prefer a metric $\|{*}-{*}\|_f$ with a more complicated definition.

Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map between metric spaces. 
Consider the pseudometric on $X$ defined as
\[\llangle x-y\rrangle_f
=
\inf
\set{\length(f\circ\gamma)_Y}{\gamma\ \text{a path in}\  X\ \text{connecting}\ x\ \text{and}\ y}.\]
Denote by $\llangle X\rrangle_f=X/\sim$ the quotient metric space.

For the reasonable maps $\llangle X\rrangle_f$ is isometric to $\|X\|_f$.
For example this is so if $f$ is an embedding, we omit the proof since we do not use this statement.

In general, we only have the natural length preserving map $\llangle X\rrangle_f\to \|X\|_f$,
but these spaces might be not isometric;
an example is given in \cite[4.2]{petrunin-intrinisic}.

The following equivalent definition of the pseudometric $\|{*}-{*}\|_f$ was used in \cite{petrunin-intrinisic}.
Given $\eps>0$ and two points $x,y\in X$ 
define 
\[\|x-y\|_f=\lim_{\eps\to0}
\left[\sup\left\{\,\sum_i|f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1}|_Y\,\right\}\right]\eqlbl{eq:eps-chain}\]
where the infimum is taken for all possible \emph{$\eps$-chains} $x=x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n=y$ in $X$;
that is, $x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n\in X$ is a point array such that $|x_i-x_{i-1}|_X<\eps$ for any $i$.
Again, we do not prove the equivalence since it is not used.




\section{Metric minimizing maps}\label{Metric minimizing maps}

Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces and $A\subset X$ be a closed subset.
Given a map $f\:X\to Y$
we will write 
\[f\succcurlyeq h\rel{A}\] 
if $f|_A=h|_A$ and there is a short map $\sigma\:\|X\|_f\to \|X\|_h$ 
such that 
\[\sigma\circ\bar{\bar\pi}_f(a)=\bar{\bar\pi}_h(a)\] for any $a\in A$.
We will write 
\[f\succ h\rel{A}\] 
if in addition the strict inequality
\[\|\sigma(x)-\sigma(y)\|_f>\|x-y\|_h\] 
holds for at least one pair of points $x,y\in X$.


The map $f\:X\to Y$ is called \emph{metric minimizing relative to $A$}
if there is no map $h\:X\to Y$ such that $f\succ h\rel{A}$.

We say that $f\:X\to Y$ is \emph{strictly metric minimizing relative to $A$}
if there is no map $h\:X\to Y$ distinct from $f$
such that $f\succcurlyeq h$, 
and $h|_A=f|_A$.

The following proposition follows directly from the definition.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:memicrit}
Let $X$ be a compact geodesic space, $Y$ a metric space 
and $A\subset X$ a closed subset.
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map.
Recall that 
$f$ is a composition of $\bar\pi_f\: X\to|X|_f$ and a length-preserving light map $\bar f\:|X|_f\to Y$.

Then the following holds.
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item\label{prop:memicrit:bar-f} The map $f$ is metric minimizing relative to $A$
if and only if $\bar f$ is metric minimizing relative to $\bar\pi_f(A)$;
\item\label{prop:memicrit:retriction} If the map $f$ is metric minimizing relative to $A$ then its restriction
$f|_C$ to any closed set $C\subset X$ is metric minimizing relative to 
\[C_A=\partial_X C\cup (A\cap C).\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{thm}


%\parit{Proof.}
%Assume that $f$ is metric minimizing relative to $A$ but there is a map $s\:|X|_f\to Y$ with $\bar f\succ s$. 
%Then there is a surjective short map $\||X|_f\|_{\bar f}\to\||X|_f\|_s$ which strictly contracts the distance of at least one pair of points.
%This is a contradiction because $s\circ\bar\pi_f|_A=f|_A$ and, by Lemma \ref{lem:idem}, $\||X|_f\|_{\bar f}\cong\|X\|_f$ and $\||X|_f\|_s\cong\|X\|_{s\circ\bar\pi_f}$. 

%If on the other hand $\bar f$ is metric minimizing relative to $\bar\pi_f(A)$ but there exists a map $s\:X\to Y$ with $f\succ s$, then there is a surjective short map $\alpha\:\|X\|_f\to\|X\|_s$ which strictlycontracts the distance of at least one pair of points and such that $\bar\pi_s=\alpha\circ\bar\pi_f$. 
%Again, by Lemma \ref{lem:idem}, we have  $\||X|_f\|_{\bar f}\cong\|X\|_f$ and $\||X|_f\|_s\cong\|X\|_{\bar s\circ\alpha}$, a contradiction.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:point-complement}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces and $A\subset X$ be a closed subset.
Assume $X$ is connected and $f\:X\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map relative to $A$.
Then $f$ \label{page:no-bubble}\emph{has no bubbles}; that is, for any point $x\in X$ any connected component of $X\backslash [x]_f$ intersects $A$.

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume the contrary.
Denote by $W$ the connected component of $X\backslash [x]_f$ such that $A\cap W=\emptyset$.
Let us define the new map $h\:X\to\ Y$ by setting $h(z)=f(x)$ for any $z\in W$ and $h(z)=f(z)$ for any $z\notin W$.

By construction $f$ and $h$ agree on $A$ and $f\succcurlyeq h$.

Note that $\|x-y\|_f>0=\|x-y\|_h$ for any $y\in W$.
Therefore $f\succ h$, a contradiction.
\qeds

Our next aim is to 
find continuous metric minimizing maps below a given map with respect to the partial order ``$\succcurlyeq$''.

\begin{thm}{Definition}(Intrinsic continuity)
A map $f\:X\to Y$ from a metric space $X$ to a metric space
 $Y$ is called
{\em intrinsically continuous}, if for every $y\in X$ 
and every $\eps>0$ there
exists $\delta>0$ such that any  $y'\in X$
with $|y-y'|<\delta$ can be connected to $y$ by a path $\gamma$ 
with $\length(f\circ\gamma)<\eps$.
\end{thm}

\parbf{Remarks.}
\begin{itemize}
 \item The main example of intrinsically continuous maps are Lipschitz
maps from length spaces to arbitrary metric spaces.
\item Restrictions of intrinsically continuous maps to compact sets are uniformly intrinsically continuous. %???I DID NOT GET THIS???
\item If a map $f\:X\to Z$ is intrinsically continuous, then 
the natural projection $\bar\pi_f\:X\rightarrow \|X\|_f$ is continuous. 
If, moreover, $X$ is compact, then $\|X\|_f$ equipped with the induced 
metric is a geodesic space.
\end{itemize}


Let $X$ be a compact geodesic space and $Y$ a $\CAT[0]$ space. 
Fix a map $f\:X\to Y$.
Note that if $f$ is intrinsically continuous then so is any $g$ such that $f\succcurlyeq g$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:exist}
If $X$ is a compact geodesic space and $Y$ a $\CAT[0]$ space, then for every subset $A\subset X$ and every intrinsically continuous map $f\:X\rightarrow Y$,
there is an intrinsically continuous  metric minimizing map $s\:X\rightarrow Y$
such that $f\succcurlyeq s$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a maximal well-ordered subset with respect to ``$\succcurlyeq$'' containing $f$. 
We need to show that $\mathcal{O}$ has a minimum.

Assume contrary.
Note that
$$
\mathcal{F}
=
\set{A\subset\mathcal{O}}{\mathcal{O}-A\text{ has a lower bound in }\mathcal{O}}.
$$
is nonprincipal filter.
Complete $\mathcal{F}$ to an ultrafilter $\omega$. 

Denote by $Y^\omega$ the ultrapower of $Y$. 
Then $Y^\omega$
is a $\CAT[0]$ space which contains $Y$ as a convex subset. 
The $\omega$-limit $s_\omega\:X\to Y^\omega$ is well defined, since
$f$ is intrinsically continuous. 

Denote $s'_\omega$ the composition of $s_\omega$ with the nearest point projection $Y^\omega\to Y$.
The nearest point projection to a convex set in $\CAT[0]$ space is short.
Therefore $s\succcurlyeq s'_\omega$ for any $s\in \mathcal{O}$.
That is, $\mathcal{O}$ is not maximal, a contradiction.

Given two points $p_0$ and $p_1$ in a $\CAT[0]$ space $Y$,
denote by $p_t$ the point $\gamma(t)$ on the 
the geodesic path $\gamma\:[0,1]\to Y$ such that $\gamma(0)=p_0$ and $\gamma(1)=p_1$.

Note that the map $(p_0,p_1,t)\mapsto p_t$ is continuous.
Therefore given two continuous maps $f_0,f_1\:K\to Y$,
the one parameter family of maps $f_t\:K\to Y$ is a homotopy;
further it will be called \emph{geodesic homotopy}.

Let $\gamma_{0}, \gamma_1\:\II\to Y$ be two rectifiable curves parametrized by arc length. 
We say that  $\gamma_{0}$ is {\em parallel} to $\gamma_{1}$, if the function $t\mapsto |\gamma_{0}(t)-\gamma_{1}(t)|_Y$.


\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:parpaths}
Let $\gamma_0,\gamma_1\:[0,\ell]\to Y$ be two rectifiable curves. 
Denote by $\gamma_t\:[0,\ell]\to Y$ their geodesic homotopy.
Then
\[\length\gamma_{\frac12}
\le \tfrac12\cdot\length\gamma_0 +\tfrac12\cdot\length\gamma_1\]
for any $t\in [0,1]$.

If in addition $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are parametrized by arc length and 
\[\length\gamma_{\frac12}
=\length\gamma_0
=\length\gamma_1,\] 
then $\gamma_{0}$ and $\gamma_{1}$ are parallel. 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
%Ref to existance of |\dot\gamma_0(t)|???
From comparison, we get
\[2\cdot|\dot\gamma_{\frac12}(t)|^2
\le
|\dot\gamma_{0}(t)|^2
+|\dot\gamma_{0}(t)|^2
-\tfrac12\cdot(|\gamma_{0}(t)-\gamma_{1}(t)|')^2\] 
for almost all $t$.
Taking the integral, we get the first statement.

If in addition $\gamma_0$ and $\gamma_1$ are parametrized by arc length, 
then $|\dot\gamma_{\frac12}(t)|\le 1$.

By assumption, the length of $\gamma_{\frac12}$ equals $\ell$. 
Hence $|\dot\gamma_{\frac12}(t)|=1$ for almost all $t\in[0,\ell]$. 
In particular, $\gamma_{\frac12}$
is parametrized by arc length. 

It follows that $|\gamma_{0}(t)-\gamma_{1}(t)|'=0$ for almost all $t$.
Since the function $t\zz\mapsto |\gamma_{0}(t)-\gamma_{1}(t)|$ is Lipschitz,
the latter  implies that $|\gamma_{0}(t)-\gamma_{1}(t)|$ does not depend on $t$.
That is, $\gamma_{0}$ and $\gamma_{1}$ are parallel.
\qeds

\parbf{Remark.}
In fact, it is possible to show in the above situation that the induced intrinsic metric on $[0,1]\times[0,\ell]$
for the map $(t,\tau)\mapsto \gamma_t(\tau)$ is a product metric.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:parpaths}
Let $\gamma_0,\gamma_1\:[0,1]\to Y$ be two rectifiable paths both starting in a point $p\in Y$ and of equal length $\ell>0$. 
If the lengths in their geodesic homotopy $\gamma_t$ is constant, then $\gamma_{0}=\gamma_{1}$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Uniqueness Theorem}\label{prop:strict-mm}
Let $X$ be a connected space, 
$A\subset X$ be a closed subset 
and $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space.
Assume that the map $s_0\:X\to Y$ is continuous and metric minimizing relative to $A$ and 
$s_1\preccurlyeq s_0$ for an other map $s_1\:X\to Y$.
Then there is $i\:X\to X$ such that $s_1(x)=i\circ s_0(x)$ for any $x$ in any $\|{*}-{*}\|$-metric compontent containing points from $A$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $i$ be as in the definition of preorder  $\preccurlyeq$.
Note that it is distance preserving map $\|X\|_{s_0}\to \|X\|_{s_1}$.

For $t\in[0,1]$ denote $s_t\:X\to Y$ the geodesic homotopy between $s_0$ and $i\circ s_0$. 
By Lemma~\ref{lem:parpaths},  $\|X\|_{s_{\frac12}}$ is isometric to $\|X\|_{s_0}$. 
In particular, every $s_{\frac12}$ is metric minimizing.

From Corollary \ref{cor:parpaths} we see that $s_0$ agrees with $s_1$ on the set $V$ 
which lies on finite distance from $A$ in $\|{*}-{*}\|_{s_i}$.
Hence the statement follows.

\section{Metric minimizing graphs}\label{Metric minimizing graphs}

Assume $\Gamma$ is a  finite graph and $A$ is a subset of its vertices.
Let $Y\in\CAT[0]$ and $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ be an arbitrary map.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:metric-min-graph}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space, 
$\Gamma$ a finite  graph and $A$ a subset of its vertices.
Assume $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ is metric minimizing relative to $A$.
Then
\begin{itemize}
\item each edge of $\Gamma$ maps to a geodesic
\item for any vertex $v\notin A$ and any $x\ne f(v)$
there is an edge  $[vw]$ in $\Gamma$ such that
$\measuredangle[f(v)^{f(w)}_x]\ge \tfrac\pi2$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, $f$ is strictly metric minimizing relative to $A$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{22 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(-0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/not-sufficient(1)}
%\lbl[lb]{12.5,11;$W_0$}}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

As one may see from the diagram,
the two conditions in the proposition do not guarantee that the map $f$ is metric minimizing,
the solid points form the set $A$.

\parit{Proof.}
The first condition should be obvious.

Assume the second condition does not hold at a vertex $v\zz\notin A$;
that is, there is a point $x\in Y$ such that
$\measuredangle[f(v)^{f(w)}_x]< \tfrac\pi2$
for any adjacent vertex $w$.
In this case moving $f(v)$ toward $x$ along $[f(v)x]$ decrease the lengths of all edges adjacent to $v$, a contradiction.

%???HERE IS A COPY OF SEC 10

To prove the last statement, assume there is a map $f'$ distinct from $f$ such that $f|_A=f'|_A$ and $f\succcurlyeq f'$.
Denote by $g(x)$ the midpoint of $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ for any $x\in \Gamma$. 
By comparison $f\succcurlyeq g$.
It follows that the tautological map $\|\Gamma\|_f\to \|\Gamma\|_g$ is an isometry.
The later implies that the distance $|f(v)-g(v)|$ is the same for all the vertices $v$ in $\Gamma$.
Since we have $|f(v)-g(v)|=0$ for any $v\in A$,
we get $f(v)=g(v)$ for any vertex $v$ in $\Gamma$.
Hence $f=f'$, a contradiction.
\qeds

Assume $\Gamma$ is a finite graph embedded in the plane $\RR^2$;
in particular $\Gamma$ is planar.
The complement to the unbounded connected component of $\RR^2\backslash\Gamma$ will be called filling of $\Gamma$;
it will be denoted as $\Fill\Gamma$.

The vertex of $\Gamma$ will be called \emph{boundary vertex}
if it lies in the boundary $\partial_{\RR^2}[\Fill\Gamma]$,
otherwise it will be called \emph{interior vertex}.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:planar-minimizing-graph}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space and
$\Gamma$ an embedded finite graph in $\RR^2$.
Assume $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map relative to the boundary vertices. 
Then there is a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract $W$
and the short maps $\|\Gamma\|_f\to W\to Y$ which composition is 
 $\bar f$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
By Corollary \ref{cor:fiberconnected}, the fibers of $\bar\pi_f$ are connected.
Hence $|\Gamma|_f$ is 
a planar graph and so is $\|\Gamma\|_f$.


Fix a cycle $\gamma$ in $\|\Gamma\|_f$ which bounds one of the discs in the complement $\RR^2\backslash \|\Gamma\|_f$.
Set $\ell=\length (\bar f\circ\gamma)$.

By Reshetnyak's majorization theorem, there is a convex polygon $P$ (possibly degenerate) with perimeter $\ell$ which admits 
a short map to $Y$ in such a way that $\bar f\circ\gamma$ is formed by the image of the boundary.
Note that each angle of $P$ is at least as big as 
the angle between the corresponding edges.

Prepare a polygon as above for each disc in the complement of $\|\Gamma\|_f$
and glue these polygons into $\|\Gamma\|_f$ along the natural map.
The obtained space $D$ is simply connected.
Therefore in order to show that $D$ is $\CAT[0]$,
we need to check that the sum of the angles around each interior vertex in $\|\Gamma\|_f$ is at least $2\cdot\pi$.


Assume the contrary, that is, 
the sum of the angles around a fixed interior vertex $v$ is less than $2\cdot\pi$.
The space of directions $\Sigma_{f(v)}$ is a $\CAT[1]$ space.
The directions of the edges from $v$ have a natural
cyclic order say $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_k$
such that
\[\measuredangle(\xi_1,\xi_2)+\dots+\measuredangle(\xi_k,\xi_1)<2\cdot\pi.\]
By Reshetnyak's majorization theorem,
the closed broken line $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_k$ is majorized by a convex spherical polygon $P$.
Note that $P$ lies in an open hemisphere with the pole  at some point in $P$.
Choose $x\in Y$ so that the direction form $f(v)$ to $x$ coincides with the image of the pole in $\Sigma_{f(v)}$.
This choice of $x$ contradicts the condition in Proposition~\ref{prop:metric-min-graph}.

The short maps from Reshetnyak's majorization theorem fit together to yield the existance of the required short maps.

\section{Disc retracts}\label{Metric minimizing discs}



Let us denote by $\DD$ the closed unit disc in the plane,
its boundary $\partial \DD$ is a unit circle.

Let $Y$ be a Hausdorff space and
$f\:\DD\to Y$ be a continuous map.
Recall that $f$ has \emph{no bubbles}
if for any point $p\in Y$ every connected component of the complement $\DD\backslash f^{-1}\{p\}$ contains a point from $\partial \DD$.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
A compact simply connected topological space which admits an embedding into the plane is 
called a \emph{disc retract}. 
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:disc-moore}
Let $Y$ be a metric space and a map $f\:\DD\to Y$ has no bubbles.
Then $|\DD|_f$ is homeomorphic to a disc retract.

Moreover, if $f|_{\partial\DD}$ is an embedding, then $|\DD|_f$ is homeomorphic to a disc.
\end{thm}

The proposition above is a disc version of Moore's theorem \cite{moore} proved in \cite{LW3}.

\parit{Proof.}
Form Lemma \ref{lem:picont} we know that $\bar\pi_f$ is continuous and hence $|\DD|_f$
is a compact metric space. 
The fibers of $\bar\pi_f$ are connected by Corollary \ref{cor:fiberconnected}.
Since $f$ is a no-bubble map, we see that $\bar\pi_f$ is cell-like. 
Therefore, the first claim follows from 
Corollary 7.12 in \cite{LW3}.

If the restriction $f|_{\partial\DD}$ is an embedding, then $|\DD|_f$ is homeomorphic to a disc by Schoenflies theorem.
\qeds

Given a disc retract $X$,
define its interior as a maximal open set which is homeomorphic to an open set in the plane.
By the Invariance of Domain theorem, the interior is well defined.
The complement to the interior of $X$ will be called boundary and denoted as $\partial X$.

Applying \ref{prop:point-complement} and \ref{prop:disc-moore}, we get the following.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:|D|}
Let $f\:\DD\to\ Y$ be a continuous metric minimizing map relative to $\partial \DD$.
Then $f$ has no bubbles.

In particular,  $|\DD|_f$ is homeomorphic to a disc retract. 
In case $f|_{\partial\DD}$ is an
embedding it is homeomorphic to a disc.
Moreover $\partial|\DD|_f$ is the image of $\partial \DD$
under the map $\bar\pi_f$.
\end{thm}

\section{Compactness of planar CAT[0] spaces}\label{Compactness}

A sequence of pairs $(X_n,\gamma_n)$, where $X_n$ is a metric space and $\gamma\:\SS^1\to X$ is a closed curve in $X$ is said to converge to $(X_\infty,\gamma_\infty)$ if there is a convergence of $X_n$ to $X_\infty$ in the sense of Gromov--Haudorff for which $\gamma_n$ converges to $\gamma_\infty$ pointwise.

More precisely, (1) there is a metric $\rho$ on the disjoint union 
\[\bm{X}=X_\infty\sqcup X_1\sqcup X_2\dots\]
such that the restrictions $\rho|_{X_\alpha}$ coinsides with the metric on $X_\alpha$ for any $\alpha\in\{\infty,0,1,\dots\}$ and $X_n$ converge to $X_\infty$ in the sense of Hausdorff as the subsets in $(\bm{X},\rho)$ and (2) the sequence of the compositions $\gamma_n\:\SS^1\to X_n \hookrightarrow\bm{X}$ converges to $\gamma_\infty\:\SS^1\to X_\infty \hookrightarrow\bm{X}$ pointwise.

\end{wrapfigure}


Let $X$ be a topological space with a closed curve $\gamma\:\SS^1\to X$.
If the mapping cylinder 
\[Z_\gamma=X\sqcup_{\gamma(u)\sim(u,0)}\SS^1\times[0,1]\]
is homeomorphic to the disc $\DD$ then $X$ is called \emph{disc retract} and $\gamma$ is called its \emph{boundary curve}.
Note that a disc retract (for example the one shown on the picture) may have essentially different boundary curves,
that is one is not a reparametrizationcan of the other.


Consider the class $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ of $\CAT[0]$ disc retracts with marked
boundary curves with Lipschitz constant $\ell$.


\begin{thm}{Compactness lemma}\label{lem:compact}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is compact in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\end{thm}

It follows immediately from Lemmas \ref{lem:precompact} and \ref{lem:closed} proven below.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:precompact}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is precompact in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\end{thm}

Further $\area K$ denotes the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a metric space $K$. 

\parit{Proof.}
Let $K$ be a metric space with metric $d$ and isometry class in $\mathcal {K}_\ell$.
By Reshetnyak's theorem there is a short map from a convex plane figure $F$ with perimeter at most $\ell$ onto $K$.
In particular, $\area K \le \area F \le \tfrac{\ell^2}{4\pi}$.

Fix $\eps>0$. 
Set $m=\lceil 10\cdot\tfrac\ell\eps\rceil$.
Choose $m$ points $y_1,\dots,y_m$ on $\partial K$
which divide $\partial K$ into arcs of equal length.

Consider the maximal set of points $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ such that $d(x_i,x_j)>\eps$ and $d(x_i,y_j)>\eps$.

Note that the set $\{x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_m\}$
forms an $\eps$-net in $(K,d)$.

Further note that the balls $B_i=B_{\eps/2}(x_i)$
do not overlap.
By comparison,
\[\area B_i\ge \tfrac{\pi\cdot\eps^2}{4}.\]

It follows that $n\le \tfrac{1}{\pi^2}\cdot\left(\tfrac\ell\eps\right)^2$.
That is, there is a integer valued function $N(\eps)$,
such that for  
$(K,d)$ contains an $\eps$-net
with at most $N(\eps)$ points.

In other words, set of isometry classes of metric spaces in $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is uniformly totally bounded.
Any class of metrics with this property is precompact in Gromov--Hausdorff topology; 
see for example \cite[7.4.15]{BBI}.

Since the set $\ell$-Lipschitz maps defined on $\SS^1$ with compact target is compact with respect to pointwise convergence, we conclude that $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is precompact in the described topology. 
\qeds





\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:closed}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is closed in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $(X_n,\gamma_n)$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{K}_\ell$.
Assume $X_n\to X_\infty$ and $\gamma_n\to\gamma_\infty$. 
Choose a point $p_n\in X_n$ and define
$f_n:\DD\to X_n$ by sending the geodesic $[0\theta]$ for $\theta\in\partial \DD=\SS^1$ to the geodesic path $[p_n\gamma_n(\theta)]$ with constant speed. 

By comparison, $f_n$ is $2\cdot\ell$-Lipschitz. %??? explain
The limit map $f_\infty:\DD\to X_\infty$ is also $2\cdot\ell$-Lipschitz.

Note that if two points $x$  and $y$ map to the same point $q$ under $f_\infty$, then $q$ is a branch point in $X_\infty$ and there is a path $c$ connecting 
$x$ and $y$ which also maps to $q$. 

In particular, $f^{-1}(q)$ is connected.

On the other hand, in the mapping cylinder $Z_{\gamma_{\infty}}$, the product of the geodesic path $[p\gamma(\theta)]$ with the vertical line $\theta\times [0,1]$ can be lifted to  $\DD$ we see that $X_\infty-f^{-1}(q)$
is connected as well.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:disc-moore}, $X_\infty$ is a disc retract with boundary curve $\gamma_\infty$.

\section{Key Lemma}\label{Key Lemma}


\begin{thm}{Key Lemma}\label{lem:key}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space and $s\:\DD\to Y$ 
be a metric minimizing disc relative to the boundary $\partial \DD$.
Given a finite set $F\subset \|\DD\|_s$ such that $\|x-y\|_s<\infty$ for each pair $x,y$ of points in $F$
there is 
(1) a $\CAT[0]$ space $W$, which is a disc retract with a boundary curve $\delta$,
(2) short maps $p\:F\to W$ and $q\:W\to Y$ such that
\[\bar s(x)=q\circ p(x)\] 
for any $x\in F_{\partial}=F\cap \partial |\DD|_s$
and 
\[\|p(x)-p(y)\|_q\le \|x-y\|_s\] 
for any $x,y\in F$
and (3) the points in $p(F\cap\partial\DD)$ appear on the boundary curve $\delta$ in the same order as the corresponding points in $F\cap\partial\DD$ appear on $\partial\DD$.
\end{thm} 

\parit{Proof.}
Let us connect each pair $x,y$ of points in $F$ by geodesics.

We can assume that 
every pair of the constructed geodesics 
are either disjoint, or their intersection is formed by finite collections of arcs and points.

Indeed, if some number of geodesics $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n$ has this property and we are given points $x$ and $y$, then
we choose a minimizing geodesic $\gamma_{n+1}$ from $x$ to $y$ which maximizes the time it spends in $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n$  in the order of importance.
Namely, 
\begin{itemize}
\item  among all minimizing geodesics connecting $x$ to $y$
choose one which spends maximal time in $\gamma_1$ --- in this case $\gamma_{n+1}$ intesects $\gamma_1$ along the empty set, one-point set or a closed arc.
\item among all minimizing geodesics as above
choose one which spends maximal time in $\gamma_2$ --- in this case $\gamma_{n+1}$ intesects $\gamma_2$ along at most two arcs and points.
\item and so on.
\end{itemize}

%IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT INTERSECTION OF ANY TWO GEODESIC IS EMPTY OR CONNECTED, BUT I FAILED TO MAKE IT FORMALLY???

In particular the set of all these geodesics forms a finite graph, say $\Gamma$,
embedded in $|\DD|_s$. 

According to Proposition~\ref{prop:|D|},
$|\DD|_s$ admits an embedding into the plane.
Therefore $\Gamma$ can be considered as a graph embedded into the plane.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:exist}, there is a map $u\:\Gamma\to Y$ metric minimizing relative to $\Gamma\cap\partial|\DD|_{\bar s}$ with
$\bar s|_\Gamma\succcurlyeq u$.
Hence there is a short map $\alpha\:\|\Gamma\|_{\bar s|_\Gamma}\to\|\Gamma\|_u$. 
By Corollary~\ref{cor:planar-minimizing-graph} there is a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract $W$, a length preserving embedding
$\|\Gamma\|_u\hookrightarrow W$ and a map $\hat u\:W\to Y$ extending $\bar u$. %???why not to say that q= \hat u???
Set $p=\alpha|_F$ and $q=\hat u$.

\section{Finite-whole extension lemma}\label{Finite-whole extension lemma}

The following lemma is an easy corollary of Tychonoff's theorem on product of compact topological spaces.

\begin{thm}{Finite-whole extension lemma}\label{lem:finite-whole}
Suppose that $X$ is a set 
and $Y$ is a compact topological space.
Assume that for any finite set $F\subset X$ 
a closed nonempty set of maps $\mathfrak{S}_F$ from $F$ to $Y$ is given and the following property fulfilled:
\begin{itemize}
\item For any finite set $F$ and any map $h\in \mathfrak{S}_F$
and any other subset $F'\subset F$
the restriction $h|_{F'}$ belongs to $\mathfrak{S}_{F'}$. 
\end{itemize}

Then there is a map $h\: X\to Y$ such that $h|_F\in \mathfrak{S}_F$ for any finite set $F\subset X$.
\end{thm}

Note that if $X$ and $Y$ are metric spaces and $A$ is a subset in $X$
then one can take as $\mathfrak{S}_F$ the short maps $F\to Y$ which coinside with the given short map $A\to Y$ on $A\cap F$.
This way we obtain the following corollary.
In a similar fashion, we will use the lemma in the proof of main theorem.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be a metric spaces, $A\subset X$ and $f\:A\to Y$ is a short map.
Assume $Y$ is compact and for any finite set $F\subset X$ there is a short map $F\to Y$ which agrees with $f$ in $F\cap A$.
Then there is a short map $X\to Y$ which agrees with $f$ in $A$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof of the finite-whole extension lemma.}
Given a subset $A\subset X$,
a map $f\: A\to Y$ will be called \emph{good}
if for any finite set $F\subset X$
there is $h\in\mathfrak{S}_F$ which agrees with $f$ on the intersection $F\cap A$.

We can choose a good map $f$ with the maximal domain $A$ with respect to inclusion;
that is, we can not enlarge the domain of $f$ by a single point in such a way that it remains to be good.
So far $A$ might be empty, but we will show actually that $A=X$.

Set
\[\mathfrak{S}_F'=\set{h\in \mathfrak{S}_F}{f(x)=h(x)\quad\text{for any}\quad x\in F\cap A}.\]
Note that  $\mathfrak{S}_F'$ satisfies all the assumption of the lemma.

Given a finite set $F\subset X$ and $x\in F$ consider the set
\[K(F,x)=\set{h(x)\in Y}{h\in \mathfrak{S}_F'}.\]

By assumption of lemma 
\[K(F,x)\ne\emptyset\eqlbl{Kne0}\] for any finite set $F\subset X$ and $x\in F$.
Further, note that $K(F,x)$ is closed and
\[K(F',x)\supset K(F,x)\eqlbl{KinK}\]
for any other finite set $F'$ such that 
$x\in F'\subset F$.

Assume $A\ne X$; fix $x\in X\backslash A$.
Given $y\in Y$ there is a finite set $F\ni x$ such that $y\notin K(F,x)$.
Or equivalently the intersection of all $K(F,x)$ for all finite sets $F$ including $x$ is empty.

By finite intersection property, 
we can choose a finite collection of finite sets $F_1,\dots F_n$ containing $x$ such that 
\[K(F_1,x)\cap \dots\cap K(F_n,x)=\emptyset.\eqlbl{K(F,x)}\]

Since the union $F=F_1\cup\dots\cup F_n$ is finite, \ref{Kne0} and \ref{KinK}
imply
\[K(F_1,x)\cap \dots\cap K(F_n,x)\supset K(F,x)\ne \emptyset\]
which contradicts \ref{K(F,x)}.

\section{Main theorem}\label{Main theorem}

\begin{thm}{Theorem}\label{thm:main}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space 
and $s\:\DD\to Y$ be a metric minimizing map relative to the boundary $\partial\DD$.
Assume the restriction $s|_{\partial\DD}$ is a rectifiable curve.
Then each metric component of $\|\DD\|_s$ a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract. 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
It is sufficient to consider
the case that $|\DD|_s$ is  homeomorphic to disc.
Indeed, it is sufficient to show that a triangle $[xyz]$ in $\|\DD\|_s$ is thin. 
If the above case has been proven, then by \ref{prop:memicrit}(\ref{prop:memicrit:retriction}),
the closure of each connected open component of $\|\DD\|_s\backslash ([xy]\cup[yz]\cup[zx])$
surrounded by the triangle is $\CAT[0]$.
Therefore thinness of $[xyz]$ can be proved using the same argument as in \cite{bishop}.

Since $|\DD|_s$ is a disc, we can identify $\DD$ and $|\DD|_s$
and therefore we can assume that the map $s$ is light;
that is, inverse image of any point is zero-dimensional.

Given a finite set $F\subset \DD$,
denote by $\mathcal{W}_F$
the set of isometry classes of spaces $W$ which meet the conditions of the Key Lemma~\ref{lem:key}
for $F$;
according to the key lemma~\ref{lem:key} $\mathcal{W}_F\ne\emptyset$.
Note that for two finite sets $F\subset F'$ in $\DD$,
we have $\mathcal{W}_F\supset \mathcal{W}_{F'}$.

According to the Lemma on compactness (\ref{lem:compact}) $\mathcal{W}_F$ is compact.
Therefore 
\[\mathcal{W}
=
\bigcap_{F}\mathcal{W}_F\ne \emptyset\]
where the intersection is taken over all finite subsets $F$ in $\DD$. 


Fix a space $W$ from $\mathcal{W}$;
the sapce $W$ is a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract,
such that given a finite set $F\subset \DD$ there is a short map $h_F\:F\to W$ 
and a short map $q_F\:W\to Y$ such that $q_F\circ h_F$ agrees with $s$ on $\partial\DD\cap F$.

Given a finite set $F\subset \DD$,
denote by $\mathfrak{S}_F$ the set of all maps $h_F\:F\to W$ described above.
Note that the set of maps $\mathfrak{S}_F$ satisfies the assumption of the finite-to-whole lemma \ref{lem:finite-whole}.

Indeed, the condition on the restriction of $h\in  \mathfrak{S}_F$ is evident.
To prove the closeness of $\mathfrak{S}_F$ consider a converging sequence $h_n\in  \mathfrak{S}_F$;
denote by $h$ its limit.
For each $h_n$ there is a short map $q_n\:W\to Y$ satisfying the condition above.
Pass to its ultra limit $q_\omega\:W\to Y^\omega$.
Recall that $Y$ is a convex closed set in $Y^\omega$.
In particular the closest-point-projection $\pi\:Y^\omega\to Y$ is well defined and short.
Therefore, the composition $q=\pi\circ q_\omega$ is short.
Finally note that the pair $h\:F\to W$ and $q\:W\to Y$ satisfies the condition above.

Applying the the finite-to-whole lemma \ref{lem:finite-whole},
we get a short map $h\:\DD\to W$ such that $h|_F\in \mathfrak{S}_F$
for any finite set $F\subset \DD$.

Our next aim is to show that for the map $h_F=h|_F$ we can choose one map $q$ once for all finite sets $F$.
This is done the same way as the proof of closeness of $\mathfrak{S}_F$ above.

Choose a sequence of finite sets $F_n$ such that the intersections $F_n\cap\partial \DD$ get dense and denser in $\partial \DD$, denote by $q_n$ the corresponding maps.
Let $q_\omega\:W\to Y^\omega$ be the ultralimit of $q_n$ and set $q=\pi\circ q_\omega$,
where $\pi\:Y^\omega\to Y$ is the closest point projection.
By construction $q\:W\to Y$ is short and $q\circ h$ agrees with $s$ on $\partial \DD$.

Note that $h(\partial\DD)= \partial W$.
Moreover, form ???, it follows that the restriction $h|_{\partial\DD}$ is monotonic in the following sense.
For any point $w$ in the interior of $W$ the direction from $w$ to $h(s)$ is turns monotonically for $s\in \SS^1=\partial\DD$.

??? PROBLEMS START???

Denote by $W'$ the space $W$ with removed cut-points.
Given an interior point $w\in W$ denote by $W_w$ the closure of the connected component of $w$ in $W'$.
Note that $W_w$ is closed convex set in $W$ which is homeomorphic to a disc.
Therefore the closest point projection $\theta_w\:W\to W_w$ is a short map.

The composition $\theta_w\circ h$ satisfies the assumption of  Proposition~\ref{prop:mono-disc}.
In particular $\theta_w\circ h\:\DD\to W_w$ is onto in particular $w$ belongs to the image $h(\DD)$.


Note that if $W$ is homeomorphic to a disc, the latter property implies standard monotonicity of $h|_{\partial\DD}\:\DD\to\partial W$;
that is, the inverse image $f^{-1}\{v\}$ is connected for any point $v\in\partial W$.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:mono-disc}, in this case $h$ is monotonic and in particular $\|\DD\|_h$ is isometric to $W$.
\qeds


\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:main}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space 
and $s\:\DD\to Y$ be a continuous metric minimizing map relative to the boundary $\partial\DD$.
Suppose that $\|\DD\|_s$  is separable.
Then $\|\DD\|_s$ is a $\CAT[0]$

Moreover if $s|_{\partial\DD}$ is rectifiable then $\|\DD\|_s$ is homeomorphic to a  disc retract. 
If in addition  $s|_{\partial\DD}$ is an embedding,
then $\|\DD\|_s$ is homeomorphic to a disc.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
By Proposition \ref{prop:|D|} $|\DD|_s$ is a disc retract in the general case, and a disc if $s|_{\partial\DD}$ is an embedding.
The identity map $\iota\:\|\DD\|_s\to |\DD|_s$ is continuous.
Pick a point $p\in\partial\|\DD\|_s$ and consider the geodesic 
cone $C$ from $p$ over $\partial\|\DD\|_s$.
Then $\iota|_C$ is surjective because otherwise there would be a point $q$ in the 
interior of $|\DD|_s$ such that $C$ defines a contraction of $\partial|\DD|_s$ in $|\DD|_s-\{q\}$. 
In particular $C=\|\DD\|_s$.
Since $C$ is the continuous image of a disc, we get that $\|\DD\|_s$ is compact and that $\iota$ is a homeomorphism.

\section{Harmonic discs}\label{Harmonic discs}

Let us review some definitions and properties from Sobolev space theory in metric spaces as developed in 
\cite{KS},\cite{R}, \cite{HKST} and \cite{LW}. 
For more details we refer the reader to these articles.

Denote by  $\DD^\circ$ the interior of $\DD$ and fix a complete metric space $X$.
Following Reshetnyak (\cite{R}), we say that a map $u\:\DD^\circ\to X$ has {\em finite energy}, or lies in the Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(\DD^\circ,X)$ if
\begin{itemize}
 \item $u$ is measureable and has essentially separable image. %???essentially, that is... ???
 \item There exists $g\in L^2(\DD^\circ,\RR)$ such that the composition $f\circ u$ with any short map $f\:X\to \mathbb{R}$ 
lies in the classical Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(\DD^\circ)$
 and the norm of the weak gradient $|\nabla(f\circ u)|$ is almost everywhere bounded by $g$.
\end{itemize}

If $u$ lies in the Sobolev space $W^{1,2}(\DD^\circ,X)$ then its energy 
\[E(u)=
\int\limits_{\DD^\circ}\left(\frac{1}{\pi}\cdot\int_{\mathbb{S}^1}\left|(d_zu)(v)\right|^2\cdot d_v\length\right)\cdot d_z\area\]
is finite. 
Here $d_zu$ denotes the approximate metric differential of $u$ at $z$.
(See \cite{LW}.)
Note that in the case of a Riemannian manifold $X$ the energy as define above is equal to
the classical Dirichlet energy up to a constant factor.
A map $u\in W^{1,2}(\DD^\circ,X)$ will be further called a \emph{Sobolev disc}.

Any Sobolev disc $u\:\DD^\circ\to X$ has a well defined trace $\operatorname{tr}(u)\in L^2(\partial\DD,X)$. 
(See \cite{KS} and \cite{LW}.)
If $u$ extends to a continuous map $\bar u$ on $\DD$, then $\operatorname{tr}(u)$ is represented by $\bar u|_{\partial\DD}$. 
We say that a circle $\gamma\:\partial\DD\to X$ is {\em spanned by} a Sobolev disc $u$, if $\gamma=\operatorname{tr}(u)$ is in 
$L^2(\partial\DD,X)$.

The following theorem was proved by Korevaar and Schoen,
see \cite[theorems 2.2 and 2.4.6]{KS}. 
It generalizes earlier results by Hamilton, Gromov and Schoen  \cite{H,GS}.

\begin{thm}{Dirichlet problem}\label{thm:dirichlet}
Let $\gamma$ be a circle in a $\CAT[0]$ space $X$ which can be spanned by a Sobolev disc. 
Then there is a unique energy minimizing disc $u$ which spans $\gamma$; 
that is, $u$
has the least energy among all Sobolev discs spanning $\gamma$. 
The energy minimizer $u$ is locally Lipschitz continuous in the interior of $\DD$.

Moreover, the local Lipschitz constant of $u$ depends only on the energy of $u$ and the distance to the boundary.
\end{thm}

An energy minimizing disc will be further called \emph{harmonic disc}.

Note that the energy is nonincreasing under composition with a map which nonincrease intrinisic metric.
Therefore by the uniqueness in Theorem \ref{thm:dirichlet} we get the following.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:harmonic}
Let $X$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space 
and $u\:\DD\to X$ a harmonic disc.
Then $u$ is continuous and metric minimizing relative $\partial\DD$.
\end{thm}

This proposition can be generalizes to other convex energy functionals which are monotonic in the metric differentials.
For example the energy considered in Section~\ref{sec:smooth}.

\section{Smooth surfaces}\label{sec:smooth}

In this section we show that any strictly saddle surface is locally metric minimizing.
So in particular, the metric minimizing surfaces do generalize strictly saddle surfaces.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:smooth}
Any smooth strictly saddle surface in $\RR^3$ is locally metric minimizing.
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{20 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-5 mm),b(-0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/not-sufficient-surface(1)}
%\lbl[lb]{12.5,11;$W_0$}}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

In general smooth saddle surfaces may not be globally metric minimizing.
An example homeomorphic to a pair of pants 
can be found among surfaces surrounding the triangle with three segments as shown on the picture.
We could not find examples like that among strictly saddle surfaces or discs, but it is very likely that such examples do exist.

\medskip

Let $s\:\DD\to\RR^3$ be a smooth map.

Fix an array of vector fields $\bm{v}=(v_1,\dots,v_k)$ in $\DD$. 
Consider the energy functional 
\[E_{\bm{v}}s
\df
\sum_i\int\limits_\DD |v_is|^2\cdot d_x\area.\]
Set 
\[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=\sum_iv_i(v_is).\]
It is convenient to think of the operator $s\mapsto \Delta_{\bm{v}}s$
as an analog of the Laplacian.

Note that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $E_{\bm{v}}$ is well defined for any Lipschitz map $s$.
\item $E_{\bm{v}}$ is convex, that is
\[E_{\bm{v}}[t\cdot s_1+(1-t)\cdot s_2]
\le 
t\cdot E_{\bm{v}} s_1+(1-t)\cdot E_{\bm{v}} s_2.\]
\item If $s$ is a smooth $E_{\bm{v}}$-minimizing map in the class of Lipschitz maps with given boundary data then $s$ is metric minimizing.
\item A smooth map $s\:\DD\to\RR^3$ is a $E_{\bm{v}}$-minimizing map among the class of Lipschitz maps with given boundary if and only if
\[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=0.\]

\end{enumerate}

The discussion above reduces the Proposition above to the following.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Assume $s\:\DD\to \RR^3$ is a smooth strictly saddle surface. 
Then for any interior point $p\in\DD$ there is an array of 4 vector fields $\bm{v}=(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)$ such that the equation \[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=0\eqlbl{eq:laplasian}\]
holds in an open neighborhood of $p$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote 
by $\kappa_1,\kappa_2$ the principal curvatures,
and by $e_1,e_2$ the corresponding unit principal vectors. 
Further, denote by by $a_1,a_2$ a pair of asymptotic vectors; we can assume that $a_1,a_2$ form coordinate vector fields in a neighborhood of $x$.


Set $v_1=\tfrac 1{\sqrt{|\kappa_1|}}\cdot e_1$ and $v_2=\tfrac 1{\sqrt{|\kappa_2|}}\cdot e_2$. 
It remains to show that one can choose smooth functions  $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ 
so that \ref{eq:laplasian}
holds in a neighborhood of $x$ for $v_3=\lambda_1\cdot a_1$ and $v_4=\lambda_1\cdot a_1$.

Note that the sum $v_1(v_1s)+v_2(v_2s)$ has vanishing normal part.
That is \[v_1(v_1s)+v_2(v_2s)\] is a tangent vector to the surface.

Since the $a_i$ are asymptotic,
the vectors $a_1(a_1s)$ and $a_2(a_2s)$ have vanishing normal part.
Therefore, for any choice of $\lambda_i$,
the following two vectors are also tangent
\begin{align*}
v_3(v_3s)&=\lambda_1^2\cdot a_1(a_1s)+\tfrac12\cdot a_1\lambda_1^2\cdot a_1s
\\
v_4(v_4s)&=\lambda_2^2\cdot a_2(a_2s)+\tfrac12\cdot a_2\lambda_2^2\cdot a_2s.
\end{align*}

Set $w=(\lambda_1^2,\lambda_2^2)$.
Note that the system \ref{eq:laplasian} can be rewritten as 
\[\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   1&0\\0&0
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_x
+
\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   0&0\\0&1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_y=h(x,y,w),\]
where $h\:\RR^3\to\RR^2$ is a smooth function.

Change coordinate system, by setting $x=t+z$ and $y=t-z$.
Then the system takes the form 
\[w_t+\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   1&0\\0&-1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_z=h(t+z,t-z,w),\]
which is a semilinear hyperbolic system.
According to \cite[Theorem 3.6]{bressan}, it can be solved locally for smooth initial data at $t=0$.

It remains to choose $v_3$ and $v_4$ for solution so that $\lambda_1, \lambda_2>0$ in a small neighborhood of $p$.
\qeds


\section{Final remarks}\label{Final remarks}

We do not see any way to show that a given surface is metric minimizing except by constructing an appropriate energy for which it is energy minimizing, as we did in Section~\ref{sec:smooth}.
Locally, the energy functional as in Section~\ref{sec:smooth} can be described by 3 functions defined on the disc.
These three functions are subject to certain differential equations and 
straightforward calculations show that on generic smooth saddle surfaces in $\RR^4$ 
it has no solutions even locally.

By that reason we expect that generic smooth saddle surfaces in $\RR^4$ are locally not metric minimizing. 
That is, arbitrary small neighborhoods of any point admit deformations which shrink 
the intrinsic metric and keep the boundary fixed.
On the other hand we do not single examples of saddle surface for which this condition would hold at single point.

We do not know whether the separability condition in the main theorem (\ref{thm:mainintro}) is necessary.
Note that for continuous $s$ the space $\|\DD\|_s$ maybe note separable.
For example for a cone over a Koch snowflake, the space $\|\DD\|_s$ is homeomorphic to an uncountable set of segments glued at one end --- although it is not separable it is still $\CAT[0]$.
Also as it was mention in ???, 
it is sufficiently to prove theorem assuming the disc spans a rectifiable curve.
In this case, a posteriori $\|\DD\|_s$ is compact.

\section{Alternative definition}\label{sec:alt-def}

A geodesic metric space is called planar if it admits an injective continuous map into the plane.

Let $Y$ be a metric space,
$\gamma\:\SS^1\to Y$ be a closed curve,
$X$ is a planar space 
and $s\:X\to Y$ be a map.
We say that $s$ majorize $\gamma$ if $s$ is short ant $\gamma$ factors through $s$;
that is $\gamma=s\circ\bar\gamma$ for a curve $\bar\gamma\:\SS^1\to X$.

A planar metric space $X$ is called metric minimizing filling of $\gamma$ if
$\gamma$ admits a majorization $\SS^1\xrightarrow{\bar\gamma}X\xrightarrow{s}Y$
and for any other majorization $\SS^1\xrightarrow{\bar\gamma'}X'\xrightarrow{s'}Y$ of $\gamma$
there is no short map $i\:X\to X'$ such that $\gamma'=i\circ\gamma$ which is strictly short on a pair of pints in $X$. 

\begin{thm}{Main theorem}\label{thm:mainintro}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space and $X$ minimizing filling of a closed curve $\gamma\:\SS^1\to Y$
and $\SS^1\xrightarrow{\bar\gamma}X\xrightarrow{s}Y$ be its majorization.
Then $X$ is a $\CAT[0]$. 

Moreover
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item if $\gamma$ is rectifiable then $X$ is homeomorphic to a disc retract
and $s$ uniquely determined by $\gamma$ and $\bar\gamma$;
\item if in addition $\gamma$ is a simple curve, then $X$ is homeomorphic to the disc.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}
