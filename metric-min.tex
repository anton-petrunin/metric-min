We say that a surface is metric minimizing if it does not admit a metric decreasing deformation.
We show that metric the metric minimizing surfaces in $\CAT[0]$ spaces are $\CAT[0]$.

\section{Definitions}

Let $X$ be a set.
A \emph{pseudometric} $|{*}-{*}|$ on set $X$ 
is a function $X\times X\to[0,\infty]$ (infinity is included in the codomain)
such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $|x-x|=0$, for any $x\in X$;
\item $|x-y|=|y-x|$, for any $x,y\in X$;
\item $|x-y|+|y-z|=|x-z|$ for any  $x,y,z\in X$.
\end{itemize}

If in addition we assume that $|x-y|=0$ implies $x=y$ then $\rho$ is called \emph{metric}.


A set with pseudometric or metric will be called \emph{pseudometric} or \emph{metric space}.

For any pseudometric on a set 
there is an equivalence relation ``$\sim$''
such that $x\sim y$ if and only if $|x-y|=0$.
The pseudmetric $\rho$ defines a genuine metric on the set of equivalence classes of $\sim$.
The obletined metric space will be denoted as $[X,\rho]$.

\parbf{Induced  pseudometrics.}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces.
Given a map $f\:X\to Y$,
define \emph{connecting pseudometric} $|{*}-{*}|_f$ on $X$ 
the following way
\[|x-y|_f=\inf\{\diam f(K)\},\]
where the infimum is taken for all connected sets $K\subset X$ which contain $x$ and $y$;
if there is no such set we assume $|x-y|=\infty$.

The intrinsic metric induced by $|{*}-{*}|_f$ will be denoted as 
$\|{*}-{*}\|_f$. 
That is, 
$\|x-y\|_f$ is the infimum of all numbers $\ell\ge 0$ such that for any $\eps>0$ there is an array of pints 
$x=x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n=y$ such that 
$|x_i-x_{i-1}|_f<\eps$ for any $i$ and 
\[\sum_{i=1}^n|x_i-x_{i-1}|_f<\ell.\]

The metric spaces defined by the pseudomatrics $|{*}-{*}|_f$ 
and $\|{*}-{*}\|_f$ on $X$ will be denoted as $|X|_f$ and $\|X\|_f$ correspondingly.

Given two maps $f,h\:X\to Y$ we will write $f\succcurlyeq h$ if 
\[\|x-y\|_f\ge \|x-y\|_h\]
for any pair of points $x,y\in X$.
If in addition the inequality is strict for at least one pair of points then we will write $f\succ h$.

\parbf{Metric minimizing map.}
Let $A\subset X$ be a closed subset.
The map $f\:X\to Y$ is called \emph{metric minimizing rel. $A$}
if there is no map $h\:X\to Y$ such that $f\succ h$
and $h$ agree with $f$ on $A$;
that is $h(a)=f(a)$ for any $a\in A$.

We say that $f\:X\to Y$ is \emph{strict metric minimizing rel. $A$}
if there is no map $h\:X\to Y$ distinct from $f$
such that $f\succcurlyeq h$, 
and $h$ agree with $f$ on $A$;
that is $h(a)=f(a)$ for any $a\in A$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:point-complement}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be  metric spaces 
and $A\subset X$ is a closed subset.
Assume $X$ is connected and $f\:X\to Y$ is metric minimizing map rel. $A$.
Then for any point $x\in X$ any connected component of $X\backslash [x]_f$ intersects $A$.

\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary, denote by $W$ the connected component of $X\backslash [x]_f$ such that $A\cap W=\emptyset$.
Let us define the new map $h\:X\to\ Y$ 
by setting $f(z)=f(x)$ for any $z\in W$
and $h(z)=f(z)$ for any $z\notin W$.
Note that $f\succ h$, a contradiction.
\qeds

The following two propositions follow directly from the definition of metric minimizing maps.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:subset}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be metric spaces and $A\subset X$ be a closed subset.
Assume $X$ is locally connected and $f\:X\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map rel. $A$.

Given a closed subset $W\subset X$, set 
\[A_W=\partial W\cup (A\cap W).\]
Then the restriction $f|_W$ is metric minimizing rel. $A_W$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:factor}
Let $X, X'$ and $Y$ be metric spaces and $A\subset X$ be a closed subset.
Assume $f\:X\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map rel. $A$
which factros through a continous surjective map $\phi\:X\to X'$;
that is there is a map $f'\:X'\to Y$ such that $f=f'\circ\phi$.
Then $f'\:X'\to Y$ is metric minimizing rel. $\phi(A)$.
\end{thm}

\section{Metric minimizing graphs}



\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Assume $\Gamma$ is a  finite graph and $A$ is a collection of its vertices.
Let $Y\in\CAT[0]$ and $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ is arbitrary map.
Then there is a metric minimizing map $f'\:\Gamma\to Y$ rel. $A$ such that
$f'(a)=f(a)$ for any $a\in A $ and 
$f\succcurlyeq f'$.
\end{thm} 

\parit{Proof.}???\qeds

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:metric-min-graph}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space 
and $\Gamma$ be a finite  graph and $A$ is a seubset of its vertices.
Assume $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ is is metric minimizing rel. $A$.
Then each edge of $\Gamma$ maps to a geodesic 
and for any vertex $v\notin A$ and any geodesic $[vx]$
there is a geodesic $[vw]\subset f(\Gamma)$ such that
$\measuredangle wvx\ge \tfrac\pi2$.

Moreover if $f\succcurlyeq h$
for an other map $h\:\Gamma\to Y$ such that $h(a)=f(a)$ for any $a\in A$ then $f=h$.
\end{thm}

%\lbl[lb]{12.5,11;$W_0$}}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

As one may see from the diagram,
the condition in the proposition does not guarantee that the map $f$ is metric minimizing.

\parit{Proof.}???\qeds

Assume $\Gamma$ is a finite graph embedded in the plane,
in particular it is a planar graph.

The complement to the unbounded connected component of $\RR^2\backslash\Gamma$ will be called filling of $\Gamma$;
it will be denoted as $\Fill\Gamma$.

The vertex of $\Gamma$ will be called \emph{boundary vertex}
if it lies in in the boundary $\partial\Fill\Gamma$,
otherwise it will be called \emph{interior vertex}.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space,
$\Gamma$ is a graph embedded in $\RR^2$.
If $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map rel. to the boundary vertices 
then the domain of $\Gamma$ admits a 
a $\CAT[0]$ intrinsic pseudometric which makes $f$ to be length preserving.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Fix a cycle $\gamma$ in $\Gamma$ which bounds one of the discs in the complement $\RR^2\backslash \Gamma$.
Set $\ell=\length\gamma$.

By Reshetnyak's majorization theorem, there is a polygon $P$ (possibly degenerate) with perimeter $\ell$ which admits a short map to $Y$ in such a way that $\gamma$ is formed by the image of the boundary.
Note that the angle of the polygon is at least as big as the angle between the corresponding edges.

Prepare a polygon as above for each contry of $\Gamma$
and glue a space from them as ???.
The obtained space $D$ is simply connected.
Therefore in order to show that $D$ is $\CAT[0]$,
we need to check that sum of the angles around each interior vertex in $\Gamma$ is at least $2\cdot\pi$.

Fix an interior vertex $v$.
Assume that the sum of angles around $v$ is less that $2\cdot\pi$.
The space of directions $\Sigma_{f(v)}$ is a $\CAT[1]$ space.
The directions of the edges from $v$ give a cyclically ordered sequence say $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_k$
such that
\[\measuredangle(\xi_1,\xi_2)+\dots+\measuredangle(\xi_k,\xi_1)<2\cdot\pi.\]
By Reshetnyak's majorization theorem,
the closed broken line $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_k$ is majorized by a convex spherical polygon $P$.
Note that $P$ lies in an open hemisphere with the pole  at some point in $P$.
Choose $x\in Y$ so that the direction form $f(v)$ to $x$ coinsides with the image of the pole in $\Sigma_{f(v)}$.
This choice of $x$ contradicts the condition in Proposition~\ref{prop:metric-min-graph}.\qeds







\section{Metric minimizing discs}



Let us denote by $\DD$ the closed unit disc in the plane,
its boundary $\partial \DD$ is a unit circle.

Assume $f\:\DD\to X$ is a continuous map.
Let us consider the disc $\DD$ as a subset in the sphere $\SS^2$.
For any $x\in \DD$, we define $[x]_f$ as above
and 
if $x\in \SS^2\backslash \DD$, set $[x]_f=\{x\}$.
Denote by $\SS^2_f$ the set of classes $[x]_f$ with quotient topology induced by the map $\iota_f\:x\mapsto [x]_f$.

According to Moore's theorem \cite{moore},
if the set $\SS^2\backslash[x]_f$ is connected for any $x\in \SS^2$
then $\SS^2_f$ is homeomorphic to $\SS^2$.
Applying Proposition~\ref{prop:point-complement} we get the following.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $f\:\DD\to\ Y$ be a metric minimizing map rel. $\partial \DD$.
Then $|\DD|_f$ is compact and it admits an embedding $\iota\:|\DD|_f\to \RR^2$.

Moreover the image of $\partial \DD$
under the map $x\mapsto [x]_f$
is 
\[\partial|\DD|_f\df\iota^{-1}(\partial_{\RR^2}[\iota(|\DD|_f)]).\]

\end{thm}

Note that the map $f\:\DD\to Y$ factors through the projection 
$\DD\to|\DD|_f$ defined as $x\mapsto[x]_f$.
Define $f'\:|\DD|_f\to Y$ as the map such that $f(x)=f'([x]_f)$ for any $x\in\DD$.

By Proposition \ref{prop:factor} the map $f'\:|\DD|_f\to Y$
is metric minimizing rel. $\partial|\DD|_f$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $Y\in\CAT(0)$ 
and 
$f\:\DD\to Y$ be a metric minimizing disc.
Then $\|\DD\|_f$ is a complete metric space.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote by $W$ be completion of $\|\DD\|_f$.
Note that the map $f\:\DD\to Y$ extends naturally to the map $\bar f\:W\to Y$.

Clearly $\bar f(W)\subset f(\DD)$. 
It follows that if $\|\DD\|_f$ is a proper subset of $W$
then $\bar f$ is not injective.

\section{Key Lemma}


\begin{thm}{Key Lemma}\label{lem:key}
Let $s\:\DD\to Y$ 
be a metric minimizing disc rel. the boundary $\partial \DD$
in a $\CAT(0)$ space $Y$.
Given a finite set $F\subset \DD$
there a $\CAT(0)$ space $W$ which is homeomorphic to a compact subset of the plane
and the maps $p\:F\to W$ and $q\:W\to Y$ such that
$s(x)=q\circ p(x)$ for any $x\in F\cap \partial \DD$
and $\|p(x),p(y)\|_q\le \|x-y\|_s$ for any $x,y\in F$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
According to ???, we can assume that $s$ is a pseudoimmersion.
In particular, 
for any two points $x$ and $y$ in $\DD$ such that $|x-y|_s<\infty$,
can be joined by a geodesic.

Let us connect all points in $F$ by geodesics.
We can assume that 
every pair of the constructed geodesics 
are either disjoint, or their intersection is connected.
This can be proved by induction on number of geodesics.
%???A FORMAL PROOF IS NEEDED!!!


In particular the set of all these geodesics forms a finite graph, say $\Gamma$,
embedded in $\DD$. 

Denote by $\tau$ a triangulation of $\DD$ which contains $\Gamma$ in its $1$-skeleton.

The $0$-skeletons of $\tau$ will be denoted by $\tau^0$.
Note that $\tau^0\supset F$. 
Given two points $x,y\in \tau^0$ we will write 
$x \leftrightarrow y$ if $x$ and $y$ are the ends of an edge in $\tau$. 
Given two maps $a,b\:\tau^0\to Y$ we will write
$a\succcurlyeq b$ if 
\[x\leftrightarrow y\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ |a(x)-a(y)|\ge |b(x)-b(y)|.\]
If at least one of the inequalities is strict, we will write $a\succ b$.

Denote by $\mathcal{A}$ the class of maps $a\:\tau^0\to Y$ such that
$a(x)=s(x)$ for any $x\in F\cap\partial \DD$ and $s|_{\tau^0}\succcurlyeq a$.
Let us show that in this class we can choose a minimal map $a^*$ with respect to $\succcurlyeq$;
that is, there is no map $a$ in the class such that  $a^*\succ a$.

Note that we can choose a decreasing sequence 
$a_1
\succcurlyeq
a_2
\succcurlyeq
\dots $
in $\mathcal{A}$ such that for any $a\in \mathcal{A}$
we have $a_n\not\succcurlyeq a$ for some $n$.

If $Y$ is locally compact, 
take $a^*$ to be partial limit of $(a_n)$,
it is defined by Arzel\'a--Ascoli theorem.

If $Y$ is not locally compact then by assumptions $Y\in\CAT(0)$.
In this case we can show that the sequence $a_1\succcurlyeq a_2\succcurlyeq\dots $ converges.
Fix a pair $x\leftrightarrow y$ and set $\ell_n=|a_n(x)-a_n(y)|$.
Note that $\ell_n$ is nonincresing therefore converging sequence.

Now assume that $(a_n)$ diverge,
then for a fixed $\eps>0$ and fixed  $x\in\tau^{0}$
we can pass to a subsequence of $(a_n)$ so that
$|a_{n+1}(x)-a_{n}(x)|>\eps$ for any $n$.

Let us equip $\tau$ with a metric $d$,
such that each triangle $[xyz]$ in $\tau$ is isometric to (possibly degenerate) plane triangle with sides $|a^*(x)-a^*(y)|_Y$,
$|a^*(y)-a^*(z)|_Y$ and  $|a^*(z)-a^*(x)|_Y$.

Note that $(\tau,d)$ is $\CAT(0)$.
Indeed ???

Hence the statement follows.

\section{Lemma on compactness}

\begin{thm}{Lemma}
Let $K_\ell$ be the set of isometry classes of $\CAT(0)$ metrics on the disc $\DD$ with the length of the boundary at most $\ell$.
The $K_\ell$ is precompact in Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Consider a metric $d$ on $\DD$ with isometry class in $K_\ell$.
Note that $\area (\DD,d)\le \ell^2$.

Fix $\eps>0$. 
Set $N=\lceil 10\cdot\tfrac\ell\eps\rceil$.
Choose $N$ points $y_1,\dots,y_N$ on $\partial D$
which divide $\partial D$ into arcs of equal length.

Consider the maximal set of points $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ such that $d(x_i,x_j)>\eps$ and $d(x_i,y_j)>\eps$.

Note that the set $\{x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_N\}$
forms an $\eps$-net in $(\DD,d)$.

Further note that the balls $B_i=B_{\eps/2}(x_i)$
do not overlap and $\area B_i\ge \tfrac{\pi\cdot\eps^2}{4}$.
It follows that $n\le 2\cdot\left(\tfrac\ell\eps\right)^2$.
That is, there is a function $N(\eps)$,
which returns a positive integer for any $\eps>0$
such that for any 
$(\DD,d)$ contains an $\eps$-net
with at most $N(\eps)$ points.
According to Theorem ???, 
any class of metrics with such property is precompact in Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\qeds


\section{Proof assembling}

Note that it is sufficient to prove the theorem 
in the case if $\partial \DD$ is rectifiable with respect to $|{*}{*}|_s$.

Indeed, fix a triangle $\triangle$ in $(\DD,|{*}{*}|_s)$.
If the above case is proved 
then it bounds a $\CAT[0]$ disc in $(\DD,|{*}{*}|_s)$.
In particular the comparison holds for $\triangle$.
Since $\triangle$ is arbitrary, the statement follows.

Given a fine set $F\subset \DD$,
denote by $W_F$
the set of isometry classes $(\triangle,d)$ for $d\in {M}_F$.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:GH-compact}
$W_F$
is compact in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\end{thm}

Note that $W_F\supset W_{F'}$
for any two finite sets $F\subset F'$ in $\DD$.
From Lemma~\ref{lem:GH-compact}, we get
\[W
=
\cap_{F}W_F\ne \emptyset.\]

Fix a dense sequence of points $\{x_1,x_2,\dots\}$ in $\DD$,
such that the subsequence of points in $\partial \DD$
is also dense in $\partial \DD$.
Set $F_n=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$.
By construction $K$ is isometric to $(\DD,d)$ for some $d\in\mathcal{M}_{F_n}$;
denote by $\iota_n\:(\DD,d)\to K$ the isometry.

Passing to a subsequence by $n$ we can ensure that the sequence
$z_n=\iota_n(x_k)$ for every $k$;
define $\iota(x_k)$ to be its limit.
Note that $\iota$ is short, therefore it can be extended to whole $\DD$ as a short map which we will still denote as $\iota$.
