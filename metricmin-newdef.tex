\begin{abstract}
A surface which does not admit a length nonincreasing deformation is called \emph{metric minimizing}.
We show that metric minimizing surfaces in $\CAT[0]$ spaces are $\CAT[0]$ with respect to their intrinsic metric.

\section{Introduction}

Let us denote by $\DD$ the closed unit disc in the plane,
its boundary $\partial \DD=\SS^1$ is a unit circle.
Let $Y$ be a metric space and $\gamma\:\SS^1\to Y$ is a closed rectifiable curve.

Assume that a continuous map $s\:\DD\to Y$ \emph{spans} $\gamma$;
that is, the restriction of $s$ to $\SS^1$ coincides with $\gamma$.
Consider the induced length-pseudometric on $\DD$ defined as 
\[\<x-y\>_s=\inf_\alpha\{\length\alpha\},\]
where the exact upper bound is taken for all paths $\alpha$ from $x$ to $y$ in $\DD$;
the distance $\<x-y\>_s$ might take infinite value.
The corresponding metric space will be denoted by $\<\DD\>_s$ (see the next section for the precise definition).

The space $\<\DD\>_s$ comes with the projection $ \hat\pi_s\:\DD\to\<\DD\>_s$;
the restriction of $ \hat\pi_s$ to $\SS^1=\partial\DD$ will be denoted by $\delta_s$.

Assume $s$ and $s'$ are two maps spanning the same curve.
We write $s\succcurlyeq s'$ if there is a \emph{majorization}
$\mu\:\<\DD\>_s\to \<\DD\>_{s'}$;
that is, $\mu$ is a short map such that $\delta_{s'}=\mu\circ\delta_s$.

A spanning map $s$ is called \emph{metric minimizing disc} if $s\succcurlyeq s'$ implies that the corresponding majorization $\mu$ is an isometry.

\end{wrapfigure}

A topological space $W$ with a choice of closed curve $\delta\:\SS^1\zz\to W$ is called \emph{disc retract} it the mapping cylinder of $\delta$ 
\[W_\delta=W\bigsqcup_{\delta(u)\sim(u,0)}\SS^1\times[0,1]\]
is homeomorphic to the disc $\DD$.
The curve $\delta$ will be called \emph{boundary curve} of the disc retract $W$.
Note that a disc retract (for example the one shown on the picture) may have essentially different boundary curves,
that is one is not a reparametrizationcan of the other.

\begin{thm}{Theorem}
Assume $Y$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space and $s\:\DD\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map.
Then $\<\DD\>_s$ is a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract with boundary curve $\delta_s$.
\end{thm}

Note that we did not make any assumption on the continuous map $s$,
in particular, before hand, the space $\<\DD\>_s$ might have wild topology.

\section{Definitions}

\parbf{Metrics and pseudometrics.}
Let $X$ be a set.
A \emph{pseudometric} on a set $X$ 
is a function $X\times X\to[0,\infty]$ denoted as $(x,y)\mapsto |x-y|$
such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $|x-x|=0$, for any $x\in X$;
\item $|x-y|=|y-x|$, for any $x,y\in X$;
\item $|x-y|+|y-z|\ge|x-z|$ for any  $x,y,z\in X$.
\end{itemize}
If in addition $|x-y|=0$ implies $x=y$ then the pseudometric $|{*}-{*}|$ is called a \emph{metric}; some authors prefer to call it \emph{$\infty$-metric} to emphasize that the distance between points might be infinite.
The value $|x-y|$ will also be called \emph{distance} form $x$ to $y$.

For any pseudometric on a set there is an equivalence relation ``$\sim$'' such that 
\[x\sim y\quad\iff\quad|x-y|=0.\]
The pseudometric induced  on the set of equivalence classes 
\[[x]=\set{x'\in X}{x\sim x}\] becomes a metric.
The obtained metric space will be denoted as $[X]$;
it comes with the projection map $X\to [X]$ defined as $x\mapsto [x]$.


For a metric space we can consider the equivalence relation ``$\approx$'' defined as 
\[x\approx y\quad\iff\quad|x-y|<\infty.\]
Its equivalence classes are called \emph{metric components}.
Note that by definition each metric component is a \emph{genuine} metric space, meaning that distance between points may take only finite values.
Consequently, a metric space can be thought of as a disjoint union of genuine metric spaces.

\parbf{Pseudometrics induced by maps.}
Assume $X$ is a topological space and $Y$ is a metric space.
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map. 

Let us define the \emph{length pseudometric} on $X$ induced by $f$ as
\[\< x-y\>_f
=
\inf
\set{\length(f\circ\gamma)_Y}{\gamma\ \text{a path in}\  X\ \text{connecting}\ x\ \text{and}\ y}.\]
Denote by $\< X\>_f$ the corresponding metric space; that is 
\[\< X\>_f=[(X,\<{*}-{*}\>_f)].\] 

Similarly, define a \emph{connecting pseudometric} $|{*}-{*}|_f$ on $X$ in
the following way
\[|x-y|_f=\inf\{\diam f(K)\},\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken over all connected sets $K\subset X$ which contain $x$ and $y$;
if there is no such set we set $|x-y|_f=\infty$. 

The associated metric space will be
denoted as $|X|_f$;
that is 
\[| X|_f=[(X,|{*}-{*}|_f)].\]

For the projections 
\[\bar \pi_f\:X\to |X|_f\quad\text{and}\quad \hat \pi_f\:X\to \<X\>_f\]
we will also use shortcut notation 
\[\bar x=\bar\pi_f(x) \quad\text{and}\quad  \hat x= \hat \pi_f(x).\]

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:picont}
Assume $X$ is a locally connected topological space, $Y$ is a metric space and $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map. 
Then $\bar\pi_f\:X\to|X|_f$ is continuous.
In particular, if in addition $X$ is compact then so is $|X|_f$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Fix $\bar x\in |X|_f$.
Consider two $\eps$-balls $B(\bar x,\eps)_{|X|_f}$ and $B(f(x),\eps)_{Y}$.

Note that the inverse image
\[V=\pi_f^{-1}[B(\bar x,\eps)_{|X|_f}]\]
is the connected component of $x$ in the inverse image 
\[W=f^{-1}[B(f(x),\eps)_{Y}].\]
Since $X$ is locally connected, the set $V$ is open.
Hence the statement follows.\qeds

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{wrapfigure}

Note that $\tau_f\: \hat x\to \bar x$ defines a map $\tau_f\: \<X\>_f\to |X|_f$ and by construction it is length-preserving.
Since $\<X\>_f$ is a length space, the latter implies that $\tau_f$ short.
The map $\tau_f$ might not induce an isometry
\[\<X\>_f\to\<|X|_f\>_{\bar f}.\]
Moreover, in general $\tau_f$ might be not injective, an example is given in \cite[4.2]{petrunin-intrinisic},
but this is the case for metric minimizing discs $f\:\DD\to Y$; see
Proposition~\ref{prop:|D|}.

The maps $\bar f\:|X|_f\to Y$ and $ \hat f\:\<X\>_f\to Y$ are uniquely defined by the identity
\[f(x)=\bar f(\bar x)=  \hat f( \hat x)\] for any $x\in X$.
By construction, the diagram commutes.

\parbf{Metrics induced by metrics.}
%???formally this par is irrelevant, but I think to include it here to provide a better picture 
If $X$ is a metric space, these two constructions above can be applied for the identity map $\id\:X\to X$.
In this case the obtained spaces $\<X\>_\id$ and $|X|_\id$ will be dented by $\<X\>$ and $|X|$ correspondingly.
The space $\<X\>$ is $X$ equipped with induced intrinsic metric.
The spaces $\<X\>$, $|X|$ and $X$ have the same underlying space;
in other words they can be considered as one set with different metrics and it defines tautological maps between them.
Both tautological map 
\[\<X\>\to |X|\to X\]
are short and length-preserving.

In particular the tautological map $\<|X|_f\>_{\bar f}\zz\to \<|X|_f\>$ is an isometry;
that is, for any continuous map $f\:X\to Y$ the induced length metric on $|X|_f$ coincides with the length metric induced by $\bar f\:|X|\to Y$.


Recall that geodesic in a metric space is a curve which lenght conisides with the distance between its endpoints.
A metric space is called \emph{geodesic} if any two points on finite distance can be joined by a geodesic.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:geospace}
Let $X$ be a compact metric space. 
Then $\<X\>$ is a complete geodesic space.
\end{thm}

The second statement is a classical (see for example \cite[II-\S8 Thm. 3]{KF}), 
we were not be able to find the first one in the literature.

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary $\<X\>_f$ is not complete.
Fix a sequence $(x_n)$ in $\<X\>_f$ converging in itself, but not converging in $\<X\>_f$.
After passing to a subsequence, we can assume that the points of the sequence appear on a rectifiable curve $\hat\gamma\:[0,1)\to\<X\>$ in the same order.

The corresponding curve $\gamma\:[0,1)\to X$ has the same length.
Since $X$ is compact we can extend it to a path $\gamma_+\:[0,1]\to X$.
The curve 
\[\hat\gamma_+=\hat\pi\circ\gamma_+\:[0,1]\to\<X\>\]
has the same length.
Therefore $\hat\gamma_+(1)$ is the limit of $(x_n)$, a contradiction.

Now let us show that $\<X\>$ is geodesic.
Assume $\gamma_n$ is a sequence of constant speed paths from $x$ to $y$ in $X$
such that $\length\hat\gamma_n\to \<x-y\>$ as $n\to\infty$.
Since $X$ is compact, we can pass to its partial limit $\gamma$ of  $\gamma_n$.
The corresponding curve $\hat\gamma=\hat \pi\circ\gamma$ is the needed geodesic from $\hat x$ to $\hat y$ in $\<X\>$.
\qeds

\parbf{Monotone-light decomposition.}
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a map between topological spaces.
Recall that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is called \emph{monotonic} if the inverse image of each point is connected,
 \item $f$ is called \emph{light} if the inverse image of any point totally disconnected.
\end{itemize}
Since connected set is nonempty by definition, any monotonic map is onto.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{cor:fiberconnected}
Assume $X$ is a compact topological space and $Y$ is a metric space.
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map.
Then the map $\bar \pi_f$ is monotonic and $\bar f$ is light.
In particular 
\[f=\bar f\circ\bar\pi_f\]
is a monotone-light decomposition. 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
The lightness of $\bar f$ should be evident.

Assume contrary $\bar\pi_f$ is not monotone;
that is, for some $x\in X$ the equivalence class 
\[K=\bar\pi_f^{-1}(\bar x)=\set{x'\in X}{|x-x'|_f=0}\]
can be covered by disjoint open sets $U,V\subset X$ such that each intersection 
$K\cap U$ and $K\cap V$ are nonempty.

Note that $K$ is closed.

We can assume that $x\in U$.
Pick $x'\in K\cap V$.
Then there is a sequence of connected sets $K_n\ni x,x'$ such that $\diam f(K_n)<\tfrac1n$.
For each $n$ pick a point $k_n\in K_n\backslash (U\cup V)$ and let $k$ be its partial limit.
It follows that $k\in K\backslash (U\cup V)$, a contradiction.
