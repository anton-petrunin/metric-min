A surface which does not admit a length nonincreasing deformation is called \emph{metric minimizing}.
We show that metric minimizing surfaces in $\CAT[0]$ spaces are locally $\CAT[0]$ with respect to their intrinsic metric.

\section{Introduction}

Let us denote by $\DD$ the closed unit disc in the plane.
Its boundary $\partial \DD=\SS^1$ is the unit circle.
Let $Y$ be a metric space and $\gamma\:\SS^1\to Y$ is a closed rectifiable curve.

We say that a continuous map $s\:\DD\to Y$ \emph{spans} $\gamma$,
if the restriction of $s$ to $\SS^1$ coincides with $\gamma$.
Consider the induced length-pseudometric on $\DD$ defined as 
\[\<x-y\>_s=\inf_\alpha\{\length s\circ\alpha\},\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken over all paths $\alpha$ from $x$ to $y$ in $\DD$.
The distance $\<x-y\>_s$ might take infinite values.
We denote by $\<\DD\>_s$ the corresponding metric space;
see the next section for a precise definition.

The space $\<\DD\>_s$ comes with the projection $ \hat\pi_s\:\DD\to\<\DD\>_s$;
its restriction to $\SS^1=\partial\DD$ will be denoted by $\delta_s$.

Now assume that $s$ and $s'$ are two maps spanning the same curve.
We write $s\succcurlyeq s'$ if there is a \emph{majorization}
$\mu\:\<\DD\>_s\to \<\DD\>_{s'}$;
meaning that $\mu$ is a short map with $\delta_{s'}=\mu\circ\delta_s$.

A map $s\:\DD\to Y$ will be called \emph{metric minimizing disc} if $s\succcurlyeq s'$ 
implies that the corresponding majorization $\mu$ is an isometry.

\end{wrapfigure}

A topological space $W$ together with a choice of a closed curve $\delta\:\SS^1\zz\to W$ is called \emph{disc retract} 
it the mapping cylinder of~$\delta$ 
\[W_\delta=W\bigsqcup_{\delta(u)\sim(u,0)}\SS^1\times[0,1]\]
is homeomorphic to the disc $\DD$.
The curve $\delta$ will be called \emph{boundary curve} of the disc retract $W$.
Note that a disc retract (for example the one shown on the picture) may have essentially different boundary curves,
in the sense that one is not a reparametrization of the other.

\begin{thm}{Main theorem}
Assume $Y$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space and $s\:\DD\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map.
Then $\<\DD\>_s$ is a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract with boundary curve $\delta_s$.
\end{thm}

Note that we did not make any assumptions on the continuous map $s$;
in particular, before hand, the space $\<\DD\>_s$ might have wild topology.

If we remove the condition that the boundary curve has to be rectifiable, then the space $\<\DD\>_s$ might have points of 
infinite distance from each other. However, our proof shows that all triangles with finite sides in $\<\DD\>_s$ are still thin; 
in particular each metric component of $\<\DD\>_s$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space.
In fact one can consider $\<\DD\>_s$ as a $\CAT[0]$ space where infinite distances between points are legal.

It is evident that any metric minimizing disc $s$ in a Euclidean space is saddle; 
that is for for any hyperplane $\Pi$ each of the connected components of $\DD\backslash s^{-1}\Pi$ meets the boundary.
In section \ref{sec:smooth} we prove a local converse in 3-dimensional case and show by example that there is no global converse.
We also conjecture that in 4-dimensional case even local converse does not hold.


\section{Definitions}

\parbf{Metrics and pseudometrics.}
Let $X$ be a set.
A \emph{pseudometric} on a set $X$ 
is a function $X\times X\to[0,\infty]$ denoted as $(x,y)\mapsto |x-y|$
such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $|x-x|=0$, for any $x\in X$;
\item $|x-y|=|y-x|$, for any $x,y\in X$;
\item $|x-y|+|y-z|\ge|x-z|$ for any  $x,y,z\in X$.
\end{itemize}
If in addition $|x-y|=0$ implies $x=y$ then the pseudometric $|{*}-{*}|$ is called a \emph{metric}; some authors prefer to call it \emph{$\infty$-metric} to emphasize that the distance between points might be infinite.
The value $|x-y|$ will also be called \emph{distance} form $x$ to $y$.

For any pseudometric on a set there is an equivalence relation ``$\sim$'' such that 
\[x\sim y\quad\iff\quad|x-y|=0.\]
The pseudometric induced  on the set of equivalence classes 
\[[x]=\set{x'\in X}{x\sim x}\] becomes a metric.
The obtained metric space will be denoted as $[X]$;
it comes with the projection map $X\to [X]$ defined as $x\mapsto [x]$.


For a metric space we can consider the equivalence relation ``$\approx$'' defined as 
\[x\approx y\quad\iff\quad|x-y|<\infty.\]
Its equivalence classes are called \emph{metric components}.
Note that by definition each metric component is a \emph{genuine metric space}, meaning that distance between points are finite.
Consequently, a metric space is a disjoint union of genuine metric spaces.

\parbf{Pseudometrics induced by maps.}
Assume $X$ is a topological space and $Y$ is a metric space.
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map. 

Let us define the \emph{length pseudometric} on $X$ induced by $f$ as
\[\< x-y\>_f
=
\inf
\set{\length(f\circ\gamma)_Y}{\gamma\ \text{a path in}\  X\ \text{connecting}\ x\ \text{and}\ y}.\]
Denote by $\< X\>_f$ the corresponding metric space; that is 
\[\< X\>_f=[(X,\<{*}-{*}\>_f)].\] 

Similarly, define a \emph{connecting pseudometric} $|{*}-{*}|_f$ on $X$ in
the following way
\[|x-y|_f=\inf\{\diam f(K)\},\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken over all connected sets $K\subset X$ which contain $x$ and $y$;
if there is no such set we set $|x-y|_f=\infty$. 

The associated metric space will be
denoted as $|X|_f$;
that is 
\[| X|_f=[(X,|{*}-{*}|_f)].\]

For the projections 
\[\bar \pi_f\:X\to |X|_f\quad\text{and}\quad \hat \pi_f\:X\to \<X\>_f\]
we will also use the shortcut notations 
\[\bar x=\bar\pi_f(x) \quad\text{and}\quad  \hat x= \hat \pi_f(x).\]

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:picont}
Let $X$ be a locally connected topological space and $Y$ a metric space. Assume that $f\:X\to Y$ is a continuous map. 
Then $\bar\pi_f\:X\to|X|_f$ is continuous.

In particular, if in addition $X$ is compact then so is $|X|_f$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
For a point $x\in X$ and $\eps>0$ we denote by $U$ the connected component of $f^{-1}[B(f(x),\eps)_{Y}]$ which contains $x$.
Since $X$ is locally connected, the set $U$ is open.

Note that $\bar\pi_f(U)\subset B(\bar x,2\cdot \eps)_{|X|_f}$. Hence
$\bar\pi_f$ is continuous.

Note that $\tau_f\: \hat x\to \bar x$ defines a map $\tau_f\: \<X\>_f\to |X|_f$ and by construction it is length-preserving.
Since $\<X\>_f$ is a length space, the latter implies that $\tau_f$ short.
The map $\tau_f$ might not induce an isometry
\[\<X\>_f\to\<|X|_f\>_{\bar f}.\]
In general $\tau_f$ does not have to be injective, an example is given in \cite[4.2]{petrunin-intrinisic}.
However, for metric minimizing discs $f\:\DD\to Y$ this is true; see
Proposition~\ref{prop:|D|}.

The maps $\bar f\:|X|_f\to Y$ and $ \hat f\:\<X\>_f\to Y$ are uniquely defined by the identity
\[f(x)=\bar f(\bar x)=  \hat f( \hat x)\] for any $x\in X$.
By construction, the diagram commutes.

\parbf{Metrics induced by metrics.}
%???formally this par is irrelevant, but I think to include it here to provide a better picture 
If $X$ is a metric space, the two constructions above can be applied to the identity map $\id\:X\to X$.
In this case the obtained spaces $\<X\>_\id$ and $|X|_\id$ will be denoted by $\<X\>$ and $|X|$ correspondingly.
The space $\<X\>$ is $X$ equipped with induced intrinsic metric.
All three spaces $\<X\>$, $|X|$ and $X$ have the same underlying set;
in other words they can be considered as a single space with different metrics and tautological maps between them.
Both tautological maps 
\[\<X\>\to |X|\to X\]
are short and length-preserving.

In particular the tautological map $\<|X|_f\>_{\bar f}\zz\to \<|X|_f\>$ is an isometry;
that is, for any continuous map $f\:X\to Y$ the induced length metric on $|X|_f$ coincides with the length metric induced by 
$\bar f\:|X|\to Y$.


Recall that a geodesic in a metric space is a curve whose length coincides with the distance between its endpoints.
A metric space is called \emph{geodesic} if any two points at finite distance can be joined by a geodesic.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:geospace}
Let $X$ be a compact metric space. 
Then $\<X\>$ is a complete geodesic space.
\end{thm}

The second statement is classical (see for example \cite[II-\S8 Thm. 3]{KF}) but 
we were not be able to find the first one in the literature.

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary $\<X\>_f$ is not complete.
Fix a sequence $(x_n)$ in $\<X\>_f$ converging in itself, but not converging in $\<X\>_f$.
After passing to a subsequence, we can assume that the points of the sequence appear on a rectifiable curve $\hat\gamma\:[0,1)\to\<X\>$ in the same order.

The corresponding curve $\gamma\:[0,1)\to X$ has the same length.
Since $X$ is compact we can extend it to a path $\gamma_+\:[0,1]\to X$.
The curve 
\[\hat\gamma_+=\hat\pi\circ\gamma_+\:[0,1]\to\<X\>\]
has the same length.
Therefore $\hat\gamma_+(1)$ is the limit of $(x_n)$, a contradiction.

It remains to show that $\<X\>$ is geodesic.
Assume $\gamma_n$ is a sequence of constant speed paths from $x$ to $y$ in $X$
such that $\length\hat\gamma_n\to \<x-y\>$ as $n\to\infty$.
Since $X$ is compact, we can pass to a partial limit $\gamma$ of  $\gamma_n$.
The corresponding curve $\hat\gamma=\hat \pi\circ\gamma$ is the needed geodesic from $\hat x$ to $\hat y$ in $\<X\>$.

\parbf{Monotone-light decomposition.}
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a map between topological spaces.
Recall that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is called \emph{monotonic} if the inverse image of each point is connected,
 \item $f$ is called \emph{light} if the inverse image of any point totally disconnected.
\end{itemize}
Since a connected set is nonempty by definition, any monotonic map is onto.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{cor:fiberconnected}
Assume $X$ is a locally connected compact metric space and $Y$ is a metric space.
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map.
Then the map $\bar \pi_f$ is monotonic and $\bar f$ is light.
In particular 
\[f=\bar f\circ\bar\pi_f\]
is a monotone-light decomposition. 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
First we prove the monotonicity of $\bar\pi_f$.

Assume that $\bar\pi_f$ is not monotone;
that is, for some $x\in X$ the equivalence class 
\[K=\bar\pi_f^{-1}(\bar x)=\set{x'\in X}{|x-x'|_f=0}\]
is not connected. Since $X$ is normal, we
can cover $K$ by disjoint open sets $U,V\subset X$ such that both intersections
$K\cap U$ and $K\cap V$ are nonempty.

By Lemma \ref{lem:picont}, $K$ is closed.

Assume that $x\in U$ and pick $x'\in K\cap V$.
Then there is a sequence of connected sets $K_n\ni x,x'$ such that $\diam f(K_n)<\tfrac1n$.
For each $n$ we choose a point $k_n\in K_n\backslash (U\cup V)$ and let $k$ be a partial limit.
It follows that $k\in K\backslash (U\cup V)$, a contradiction. Hence $\bar\pi_f$ is monotone.

Note that for every closed connected subset $C\subset |X|_f$ the inverse image $Z:=\bar\pi_f^{-1}C$ is
connected. Indeed, if $Z$ is the disjoint union of two compact sets $Z_1$ and $Z_2$, then the sets 
$C_i:=\set{\bar x\in C}{\bar\pi_f^{-1}(\bar x)\subset Z_i}$ are closed.
From this the lightness of $\bar f$ is evident.

\section{Smooth surfaces}\label{sec:smooth}

\parbf{Three-dimesional case.}
In general smooth saddle disc may not be globally metric minimizing.
An example is shown on the picture.
It is a saddle polyhedral disc made from 10 triangles
with a hexagon boundary forming a Y-shape marked with bold lines.


\begin{center}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(-0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/not-sufficient-disc(1)}
%\lbl[lb]{12.5,11;$W_0$}}
\end{lpic}
\end{center}

By smoothing this example one can produce a strictly saddle disc which is not metric minimizing.
As the following proposition states, there are no local examples of that type.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:smooth}
Any smooth strictly saddle surface in $\RR^3$ is locally metric minimizing.
\end{thm}

Let $s\:\DD\to\RR^3$ be a smooth map.

Fix an array of vector fields $\bm{v}=(v_1,\dots,v_k)$ on $\DD$. 
Consider the energy functional 
\[E_{\bm{v}}s
\df
\sum_i\int\limits_\DD |v_is|^2\cdot d_x\area,\]
where $vs$ denotes the derivative of $s$ in the direction of the field $v$.
Set 
\[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=\sum_iv_i(v_is).\]
It is convenient to think of the operator $s\mapsto \Delta_{\bm{v}}s$
as an analog of the Laplacian.

Note that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $E_{\bm{v}}$ is well defined for any Lipschitz map $s$.
\item $E_{\bm{v}}$ is convex, that is
\[E_{\bm{v}}[t\cdot s_1+(1-t)\cdot s_2]
\le 
t\cdot E_{\bm{v}} s_1+(1-t)\cdot E_{\bm{v}} s_2.\]
\item If $s$ is a smooth $E_{\bm{v}}$-minimizing map in the class of Lipschitz maps with given boundary data then $s$ is metric minimizing.
\item A smooth map $s\:\DD\to\RR^3$ is a $E_{\bm{v}}$-minimizing map among the class of Lipschitz maps with given boundary if and only if
\[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=0.\]

\end{enumerate}

The discussion above reduces the Proposition above to the following.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Assume $s\:\DD\to \RR^3$ is a smooth strictly saddle surface. 
Then for any interior point $p\in\DD$ there is an array of 4 vector fields $\bm{v}=(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)$ such that the equation \[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=0\eqlbl{eq:laplasian}\]
holds in an open neighborhood of $p$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote 
by $\kappa_1,\kappa_2$ the principal curvatures,
and by $e_1,e_2$ the corresponding unit principal vectors. 
Further, denote by by $a_1,a_2$ a pair of asymptotic vectors; we can assume that $a_1,a_2$ form coordinate vector fields in a neighborhood of $x$.


Set $v_1=\tfrac 1{\sqrt{|\kappa_1|}}\cdot e_1$ and $v_2=\tfrac 1{\sqrt{|\kappa_2|}}\cdot e_2$. 
It remains to show that one can choose smooth functions  $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ 
so that \ref{eq:laplasian}
holds in a neighborhood of $x$ for $v_3=\lambda_1\cdot a_1$ and $v_4=\lambda_1\cdot a_1$.

Note that the sum $v_1(v_1s)+v_2(v_2s)$ has vanishing normal part.
That is \[v_1(v_1s)+v_2(v_2s)\] is a tangent vector to the surface.

Since the $a_i$ are asymptotic,
the vectors $a_1(a_1s)$ and $a_2(a_2s)$ have vanishing normal part.
Therefore, for any choice of $\lambda_i$,
the following two vectors are also tangent
\begin{align*}
v_3(v_3s)&=\lambda_1^2\cdot a_1(a_1s)+\tfrac12\cdot a_1\lambda_1^2\cdot a_1s
\\
v_4(v_4s)&=\lambda_2^2\cdot a_2(a_2s)+\tfrac12\cdot a_2\lambda_2^2\cdot a_2s.
\end{align*}

Set $w=(\lambda_1^2,\lambda_2^2)$.
Note that the system \ref{eq:laplasian} can be rewritten as 
\[\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   1&0\\0&0
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_x
+
\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   0&0\\0&1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_y=h(x,y,w),\]
where $h\:\RR^3\to\RR^2$ is a smooth function.

Change coordinate system, by setting $x=t+z$ and $y=t-z$.
Then the system takes the form 
\[w_t+\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   1&0\\0&-1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_z=h(t+z,t-z,w),\]
which is a semilinear hyperbolic system.
According to \cite[Theorem 3.6]{bressan}, it can be solved locally for smooth initial data at $t=0$.

It remains to choose $v_3$ and $v_4$ for solution so that $\lambda_1, \lambda_2>0$ in a small neighborhood of $p$.
\qeds

\parbf{Four-dimensional case.}
We do not see any way to show that a given surface is metric minimizing except by constructing an appropriate energy for which it is energy minimizing, as we did in Section~\ref{sec:smooth}.
Locally, the energy functional as in Section~\ref{sec:smooth} can be described by 3 functions defined on the disc.
These three functions are subject to certain differential equations and 
straightforward calculations show that on generic smooth saddle surfaces in $\RR^4$ 
it has no solutions even locally.

By that reason we expect that generic smooth saddle surfaces in $\RR^4$ are locally not metric minimizing. 
That is, arbitrary small neighborhoods of any point admit deformations which shrink 
the intrinsic metric and keep the boundary fixed.
On the other hand we do not have a single examples of saddle surface for which this condition would hold at single point.
