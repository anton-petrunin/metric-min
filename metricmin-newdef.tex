A surface which does not admit a length nonincreasing deformation is called \emph{metric minimizing}.
We show that metric minimizing surfaces in $\CAT(0)$ spaces are locally $\CAT(0)$ with respect to their length metrics.

\section{Introduction}

Let us denote by $\DD$ the closed unit disc in the plane.
Its boundary $\partial \DD=\SS^1$ is the unit circle.

Assume $s\:\DD\to \RR^3$ is an embedding.
We say $s$ is \emph{metric minimizing} if a map $s'\:\DD\to \RR^3$ agrees with $s$ on $\partial \DD$ and 
\[\length s\circ\gamma\ge \length s'\circ\gamma\]
for any curve $\gamma$ in $\DD$, then the last inequality becomes equality for any $\gamma$.

As it follows from the main theorem below, the iduced metric on the disc for a metric minimizing embedding is $\CAT(0)$.

To formulate the theorem in full generality we need to extend the definition of metric minimizing maps assuming only continuity of $s$, so the map $s$ is not necesary an embedding;
this part is tricky.
We also have to define it with arbitrary metric space as the target; this part is straightforward. 

Let $Y$ be a metric space
and $s\:\DD\to Y$ be a continuous map.
Let $\gamma\:\SS^1\to Y$ be a closed rectifiable curve.
We say that $s\:\DD\to Y$ \emph{spans} $\gamma$,
if $s|_{\SS^1}=\gamma$.

Consider the induced length-pseudometric on $\DD$ defined as 
\[\<x-y\>_s=\inf_\alpha\{\length s\circ\alpha\},\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken over all paths $\alpha$ from $x$ to $y$ in $\DD$.
The distance $\<x-y\>_s$ might take infinite values.
We denote by $\<\DD\>_s$ the corresponding metric space;
see the next section for a precise definition.

The space $\<\DD\>_s$ comes with the projections $\DD\xrightarrow{\hat\pi_s}\<\DD\>_s\xrightarrow{\hat s}Y$;
the restriction $\hat\pi_s|_{\SS^1}$ will be denoted by $\delta_s$.

Assume that $s$ and $s'$ are two maps spanning the same curve.
We write $s\succcurlyeq s'$ if there is a \emph{majorization}
$\mu\:\<\DD\>_s\to \<\DD\>_{s'}$;
meaning that $\mu$ is a \emph{short} maps and $\delta_{s'}=\mu\circ\delta_s$
(here short is a shortcut for \emph{distance  non-incerasing}).

A map $s\:\DD\to Y$ will be called \emph{metric minimizing disc} if $s\succcurlyeq s'$ 
 implies that the corresponding majorization $\mu$ is an isometry.

\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

A topological space $W$ together with a choice of a closed curve $\delta\:\SS^1\zz\to W$ is called \emph{disc retract} 
if the mapping cylinder of~$\delta$ 
\[W_\delta=W\bigsqcup_{\delta(u)\sim(u,0)}\SS^1\times[0,1]\]
is homeomorphic to the disc $\DD$.
The curve $\delta$ will be called \emph{boundary curve} of the disc retract $W$.

The definition is motivated by the following observation: if the boundary curve of a disc retract $W$ is a simple closed curve then $W$ is homeomorphich to $\DD$.
Note that a disc retract (for example the one shown on the picture) may have essentially different boundary curves,
in the sense that one is not a reparametrization of the other.

\begin{thm}{Main theorem}
Assume $Y$ is a $\CAT(0)$ space and $s\:\DD\to Y$ is a metric minimizing map.
Then $\<\DD\>_s$ is a $\CAT(0)$ disc retract with boundary curve $\delta_s$.

In particular, if $s$ spans a simple closed curve then $\<\DD\>_s$ is a $\CAT(0)$ disc.
\end{thm}

The main theorem generalizes a theorem of Alexandr Alexandrov about ruled surfaces in \cite{A} and the main theorem by the first author announced in \cite{petrunin-metric-min}.
It is also closely related to the results of Samuel Shefel in \cite{shefel-2D} and \cite{shefel-3D}, the results on minimal surfaces of Alexander Lytchak and Stefan Wenger 
\cite[Theorem 1.2]{LW5}  and an earlier result of Chikako Mese \cite{mese};
see also \cite[Chapter 4]{akp} and \cite{petrunin-stadler}.

Note that apart from continuity we did not make any regularity assumptions on the map $s$;
in particular, before hand, the space $\<\DD\>_s$ might have wild topology.

If we remove the condition that the boundary curve is rectifiable, then the space $\<\DD\>_s$ might have points of infinite distance from each other.
However, our proof shows that all triangles with finite sides in $\<\DD\>_s$ are still thin; 
in particular each metric component of $\<\DD\>_s$ is a $\CAT(0)$ space.
So one can consider $\<\DD\>_s$ as a $\CAT(0)$ space where infinite distances between points are legal.

The class of metric minimizing discs is huge --- if the ambient space $Y$ is comact, then a metric minimizing  disc can be found \emph{below} any map $\DD\to Y$ with respect to $\succcurlyeq$.
The ruled discs considered by Alexandrov are evidently metric minimizing.
It is also expected that harmonic maps from disc to $\CAT(0)$ spaces are also metric minimizing.

In general it is hard to check whether a given surface is metric minimizing.
Note that any smooth metric minimizing disc in a Euclidean space is saddle.
The converse fails in general (see Section~\ref{sec:smooth}), but the following statement gives a local converse in dimension three.
We expect that in the four-dimensional case even the local converse does not hold.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:smooth}
Any smooth strictly saddle surface in $\RR^3$ is locally metric minimizing.
\end{thm}
 


\parbf{Structure of the paper.}
In Section 2 we define a couple of metrics induced by a given continuous map.
This naturally leads to the monotone-light factorization theorem in a metric context.
 
In Section 3 we obtain topological control on the length space
associated to a metric minimizing disc. 
This part follows from Moore's quotient theorem on cell-like maps.
 
Section 4 establishes compactness of a certain class of nonpositively curved surfaces.
This will be used later, when we approximate metric minimizing maps.
 
In Section 6 we prove the key lemma which roughly says that the restriction to a finite set of
a metric minimizing disc factorizes as a composition of short maps over a nonpositively curved surface.
The proof uses the properties of \emph{metric minimizing graphs} discussed in Section 5.
 
In Section 7 we prove an extension result which is of independent interest and logically detached
from the rest of the paper.
Roughly, it gives a criterion which allows to extend maps from subsets
to the whole space, once extensions on finite subsets are guaranteed.
 
In Section 8 we assemble the proof of the main theorem.
We show that a metric minimizing disc factorizes as a composition of short maps over a
nonpositively curved surface.
The proof is finished by showing that the first map of this factorization
induces an isometry.

In the last section, we discuss the relation between saddle surfaces and metric minimizing discs.

\section{Definitions}

\parbf{Metrics and pseudometrics.}
Let $X$ be a set.
A \emph{pseudometric} on $X$ 
is a function $X\times X\to[0,\infty]$ denoted as $(x,y)\mapsto |x-y|$
such that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $|x-x|=0$, for any $x\in X$;
\item $|x-y|=|y-x|$, for any $x,y\in X$;
\item $|x-y|+|y-z|\ge|x-z|$ for any  $x,y,z\in X$.
\end{itemize}
If in addition $|x-y|=0$ implies $x=y$ then the pseudometric $|{*}-{*}|$ is called a \emph{metric}; some authors prefer to call it \emph{$\infty$-metric} to emphasize that the distance between points might be infinite.
The value $|x-y|$ will also be called \emph{distance} form $x$ to $y$.

A (pseudo)metric space $X$ is the underlying set which is also denoted by $X$ equipped with a (pseuo)metric which often will be denoted by $|{*}-{*}|_X$.
We will use $X$ as an index if we want to emphasize that we are working in the space $X$;
for example the ball or radius $R$ centered at $z$ in $X$ can be denoted as
\[B(z,R)_X=\set{x\in X}{|z-x|_X<R}.\]


For any pseudometric on a set there is an equivalence relation ``$\sim$'' such that 
\[x\sim y\quad\iff\quad|x-y|=0.\]
The pseudometric induced  on the set of equivalence classes 
\[[x]=\set{x'\in X}{x\sim x}\] becomes a metric.
The obtained metric space will be denoted as $[X]$;
it comes with the projection map $X\to [X]$ defined as $x\mapsto [x]$.

For a metric space we can consider the equivalence relation ``$\approx$'' defined as 
\[x\approx y\quad\iff\quad|x-y|<\infty.\]
Its equivalence classes are called \emph{metric components}.
Note that by definition each metric component is a \emph{genuine metric space}, meaning that distances between points are finite.
Consequently, a metric space is a disjoint union of genuine metric spaces.

\parbf{Pseudometrics induced by maps.}
Assume $X$ is a topological space and $Y$ is a metric space.
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map. 

Let us define the \emph{length pseudometric} on $X$ induced by $f$ as
\[\< x-y\>_f
=
\inf
\set{\length(f\circ\gamma)_Y}{\gamma\ \text{a path in}\  X\ \text{connecting}\ x\ \text{and}\ y}.\]
Denote by $\< X\>_f$ the corresponding metric space; that is,
\[\< X\>_f=[(X,\<{*}-{*}\>_f)].\] 

Similarly, define a \emph{connecting pseudometric} $|{*}-{*}|_f$ on $X$ in
the following way
\[|x-y|_f=\inf\{\diam f(K)\},\]
where the greatest lower bound is taken over all connected sets $K\subset X$ which contain $x$ and $y$;
if there is no such set we set $|x-y|_f=\infty$. 
The associated metric space will be
denoted as $|X|_f$;
that is,
\[| X|_f=[(X,|{*}-{*}|_f)].\]

For the projections 
\[\bar \pi_f\:X\to |X|_f\quad\text{and}\quad \hat \pi_f\:X\to \<X\>_f\]
we will also use the shortcut notations 
\[\bar x=\bar\pi_f(x) \quad\text{and}\quad  \hat x= \hat \pi_f(x).\]

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:picont}
Let $X$ be a locally connected topological space and $Y$ a metric space. Assume that $f\:X\to Y$ is a continuous map. 
Then $\bar\pi_f\:X\to|X|_f$ is continuous.

In particular, if in addition $X$ is compact then so is $|X|_f$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
For a point $x\in X$ and $\eps>0$ we denote by $U$ the connected component of $f^{-1}[B(f(x),\eps)_{Y}]$ which contains $x$.
Since $X$ is locally connected, the set $U$ is open.

Note that $\bar\pi_f(U)\subset B(\bar x,2\cdot \eps)_{|X|_f}$. Hence
$\bar\pi_f$ is continuous.

\end{wrapfigure}

Note that $\tau_f\: \hat x\to \bar x$ defines a map $\tau_f\: \<X\>_f\zz\to |X|_f$ and by construction it preserves the lengths of
all curves coming from $X$.
Since $\<X\>_f$ is a length space, the latter implies that $\tau_f$ is short.
The map $\tau_f$ might not induce an isometry
\[\<X\>_f\to\<|X|_f\>_{\bar f}.\]
Moreover, $\tau_f$ does not have to be injective, an example is given in \cite[4.2]{petrunin-intrinisic}.
However, for metric minimizing discs $f\:\DD\to Y$ both statements hold true; see
Proposition~\ref{prop:|D|}.

The maps $\bar f\:|X|_f\to Y$ and $ \hat f\:\<X\>_f\to Y$ are uniquely defined by the identity
\[f(x)=\bar f(\bar x)=  \hat f( \hat x)\] for any $x\in X$.
By construction, the diagram commutes.

\parbf{Metrics induced by metrics.}
%???formally this par is irrelevant, but I think to include it here to provide a better picture 
If $X$ is a metric space, the two constructions above can be applied to the identity map $\id\:X\to X$.
In this case the obtained spaces $\<X\>_\id$ and $|X|_\id$ will be denoted by $\<X\>$ and $|X|$ correspondingly.
The space $\<X\>$ is $X$ equipped with induced length metric.
All three spaces $\<X\>$, $|X|$ and $X$ have the same underlying set;
in other words they can be considered as a single space with different metrics and tautological maps between them.
Both tautological maps 
\[\<X\>\to |X|\to X\]
are short and length-preserving.

Moreover, if $X$ is compact, then $\bar\pi_f$ has connected fibers and $\bar f\:|X|_f\to Y$ preserves the length of every curve.
As a consequence,  the tautological map $\<|X|_f\>_{\bar f}\zz\to \<|X|_f\>$ is an isometry;
that is, for any continuous map $f\:X\to Y$ the induced length metric on $|X|_f$ coincides with the length metric induced by 
$\bar f\:|X|_f\to Y$.


Recall that a geodesic in a metric space is a curve whose length coincides with the distance between its endpoints.
A metric space is called \emph{geodesic} if any two points at finite distance can be joined by a geodesic.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:geospace}
Let $X$ be a compact metric space. 
Then $\<X\>$ is a complete geodesic space.
\end{thm}

The second statement is classical (see for example \cite[II-\S8 Thm. 3]{KF}) but 
we were not able to find the first one in the literature.

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary $\<X\>_f$ is not complete.
Fix a sequence $(x_n)$ in $\<X\>_f$ that is Cauchy, but not converging in $\<X\>_f$.
After passing to a subsequence, we can assume that the points of the sequence appear on a rectifiable curve $\hat\gamma\:[0,1)\to\<X\>$ in the same order.

The corresponding curve $\gamma\:[0,1)\to X$ has the same length.
Since $X$ is compact we can extend it to a path $\gamma_+\:[0,1]\to X$.
The curve 
\[\hat\gamma_+=\hat\pi\circ\gamma_+\:[0,1]\to\<X\>\]
has the same length.
Therefore $\hat\gamma_+(1)$ is the limit of $(x_n)$, a contradiction.

It remains to show that $\<X\>$ is geodesic.
Assume $\gamma_n$ is a sequence of constant speed paths from $x$ to $y$ in $X$
such that $\length(\hat\gamma_n)\to \<x-y\>$ as $n\to\infty$.
Since $X$ is compact, we can pass to a partial limit $\gamma$ of  $\gamma_n$.
The corresponding curve $\hat\gamma=\hat \pi\circ\gamma$ is the needed geodesic from $\hat x$ to $\hat y$ in $\<X\>$.
\qeds

\parbf{Monotone-light factorization.} %???any reason you prefer decomposition???
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a map between topological spaces.
Recall that 
\begin{itemize}
\item $f$ is called \emph{monotone} if the inverse image of each point is connected,
 \item $f$ is called \emph{light} if the inverse image of any point is totally disconnected.
\end{itemize}
Since a connected set is nonempty by definition, any monotone map is onto.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{cor:fiberconnected}
Assume $X$ is a locally connected compact metric space and $Y$ is a metric space.
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map.
Then the map $\bar \pi_f$ is monotone and $\bar f$ is light.
In particular 
\[f=\bar f\circ\bar\pi_f\]
is a monotone-light factorization. 
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
First we prove the monotonicity of $\bar\pi_f$.

Assume the contrary;
that is, for some $x\in X$ the equivalence class 
\[K=\bar\pi_f^{-1}(\bar x)=\set{x'\in X}{|x-x'|_f=0}\]
is not connected. Since $X$ is normal, we
can cover $K$ by disjoint open sets $U,V\subset X$ such that both intersections
$K\cap U$ and $K\cap V$ are nonempty.

By Lemma~\ref{lem:picont}, $K$ is closed.

Suppose that $x\in U$ and pick $x'\in K\cap V$.
Then there is a sequence of connected sets $K_n\ni x,x'$ such that $\diam f(K_n)<\tfrac1n$.
For each $n$ we choose a point $k_n\in K_n\backslash (U\cup V)$.
Let $k$ be a partial limit of the sequence $(k_n)$.
It follows that $k\in K\backslash (U\cup V)$, a contradiction. 

Assume $\bar f$ is not light;
that is, the inverse image of some $y\in Y$ contains a closed connected set $C\subset |X|_f$ with more than one point.  
Note that the inverse image $Z:=\bar\pi_f^{-1}C$ is connected due to monotonicity of $\bar\pi_f$. 
It follows that $|z-z'|_f=0$ for any two points $z,z'\in Z$, a contradiction.

\section{Saddle surfaces}\label{sec:smooth}

In this section we will discuss the relation between metric minimizing discs and saddle discs.

Recall that a map $s\:\DD\to \RR^m$ is called \emph{saddle} if for any hyperplane $\Pi\subset\RR^m$ each of the connected components of $\DD\backslash s^{-1}\Pi$ meets the boundary.

If $s$ is a smooth embedding in $\RR^3$ then it is saddle if and only if the  obtained surface has nonpositive Gauss curvature. 
An old conjecture of Samuel Shefel states that any saddle disc in a $\RR^3$ is $\CAT(0)$ with respect to its length metric, see \cite{shefel-3D}.

It is evident that any metric minimizing disc $s$ in a Euclidean space is saddle.

\parbf{Three-dimensional case.}
In general a saddle disc may not be globally metric minimizing.
An example is shown in the picture.
It is a saddle polyhedral disc made from 10 triangles
with a hexagon boundary forming a Y-shape marked with bold lines.

\begin{center}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(-0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/not-sufficient-disc(1)}
%\lbl[lb]{12.5,11;$W_0$}}
\end{lpic}
\end{center}

By smoothing this example one can produce a smooth disc which is not metric minimizing, but \emph{strictly saddle} meaning the principal curvatures at each interior point have opposite signs. 

Proposition~\ref{prop:smooth} states that there are no local examples of that type.
To prove this proposition we need to introduce certain energy functional.

Let $s\:\DD\to\RR^3$ be a smooth map.

Fix an array of vector fields $\bm{v}=(v_1,\dots,v_k)$ on $\DD$. 
Consider the energy functional 
\[E_{\bm{v}}s
:=
\sum_i\int\limits_\DD |v_is|^2,\]
where $vs$ denotes the derivative of $s$ in the direction of the field $v$.
Set 
\[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=\sum_iv_i(v_is).\]
It is convenient to think of the operator $s\mapsto \Delta_{\bm{v}}s$
as an analog of the Laplacian.

Note that 
\begin{enumerate}[(i)]
\item $E_{\bm{v}}$ is well defined for any Lipschitz map $s$.
\item $E_{\bm{v}}$ is convex; that is,
\[E_{\bm{v}}[t\cdot s_1+(1-t)\cdot s_2]
\le 
t\cdot E_{\bm{v}} s_1+(1-t)\cdot E_{\bm{v}} s_2.\]
\item If $s$ is a smooth $E_{\bm{v}}$-minimizing map in the class of Lipschitz maps with given boundary data then $s$ is metric minimizing.
\item A smooth map $s\:\DD\to\RR^3$ is a $E_{\bm{v}}$-minimizing map among the class of Lipschitz maps with given boundary if and only if
\[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=0.\]

\end{enumerate}

The discussion above reduces Proposition~\ref{prop:smooth} to the following.

\begin{thm}{Claim}
Assume $s\:\DD\to \RR^3$ is a smooth strictly saddle surface. 
Then for any interior point $p\in\DD$ there is an array of 4 vector fields $\bm{v}=(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)$ such that the equation \[\Delta_{\bm{v}}s=0\eqlbl{eq:laplasian}\]
holds in an open neighborhood of $p$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Denote 
by $\kappa_1,\kappa_2$ the principal curvatures,
and by $e_1,e_2$ the corresponding unit principal vectors. 
Further, denote by $a_1,a_2$ a pair of asymptotic vectors; we can assume that $a_1,a_2$ form coordinate vector fields in a neighborhood of $p$.


Set $v_1=\tfrac 1{\sqrt{|\kappa_1|}}\cdot e_1$ and $v_2=\tfrac 1{\sqrt{|\kappa_2|}}\cdot e_2$. 
It remains to show that one can choose smooth functions  $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$ 
so that \ref{eq:laplasian}
holds in a neighborhood of $p$ for $v_3=\lambda_1\cdot a_1$ and $v_4=\lambda_1\cdot a_1$.

Note that the sum $v_1(v_1s)+v_2(v_2s)$ has vanishing normal part.
That is \[v_1(v_1s)+v_2(v_2s)\] is a tangent vector to the surface.

Since the $a_i$ are asymptotic,
the vectors $a_1(a_1s)$ and $a_2(a_2s)$ have vanishing normal part.
Therefore, for any choice of $\lambda_i$,
the following two vectors are also tangent
\begin{align*}
v_3(v_3s)&=\lambda_1^2\cdot a_1(a_1s)+\tfrac12\cdot a_1\lambda_1^2\cdot a_1s
\\
v_4(v_4s)&=\lambda_2^2\cdot a_2(a_2s)+\tfrac12\cdot a_2\lambda_2^2\cdot a_2s.
\end{align*}

Set $w=(\lambda_1^2,\lambda_2^2)$.
Note that the system \ref{eq:laplasian} can be rewritten as 
\[\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   1&0\\0&0
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_x
+
\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   0&0\\0&1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_y=h(x,y,w),\]
where $h\:\RR^3\to\RR^2$ is a smooth function.

Change coordinates by setting $x=t+z$ and $y=t-z$.
Then the system takes the form 
\[w_t+\left(\begin{smallmatrix}
   1&0\\0&-1
  \end{smallmatrix}\right)
w_z=h(t+z,t-z,w),\]
which is a semilinear hyperbolic system.
According to \cite[Theorem 3.6]{bressan}, it can be solved locally for smooth initial data at $t=0$.

It remains to choose $v_3$ and $v_4$ for solution so that $\lambda_1, \lambda_2>0$ in a small neighborhood of $p$.
\qeds

\parbf{Four-dimensional case.}
Except for constructing an energy as we did above,
we do not see any way to show that a given smooth surface is metric minimizing.
Locally, the appropriate energy functional can be described by three functions defined on the disc.
These three functions are subject to certain differential equations.
Straightforward computations show that on generic smooth saddle surfaces in $\RR^4$ 
there is no solution even locally.

By that reason we expect that generic smooth saddle surfaces in $\RR^4$ are not locally metric minimizing. 
That is, arbitrary small neighborhoods of any point admit deformations which shrink 
the length metric and keep the boundary fixed.
On the other hand we do not have an example of a saddle surface for which this condition would hold at a single point.
