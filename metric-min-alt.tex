\begin{abstract}
A surface which does not admit a length nonincreasing deformation is called \emph{metric minimizing}.
We show that reasonable metric minimizing surfaces in $\CAT[0]$ spaces are $\CAT[0]$ with respect to their intrinsic metric.

\section{Introduction}

A geodesic metric space is called planar if it admits an injective continuous map into the plane.

To see a source of examples of planar spaces,
start with arbitrary metric on the disc $\DD$,
equip $\DD$ with the induced intrinsic metric
and pass to its metric component.
The obtained space is planar; see ??? below.
In particular, any metric planar graph is a planar space.

Let $Y$ be a metric space,
$\gamma\:\SS^1\to Y$ be a closed curve,
$X$ is a planar space 
and $s\:X\to Y$ be a map.
We say that $s$ majorize $\gamma$ if $s$ is short and $\gamma$ factors through $s$;
that is $\gamma=s\circ\bar\gamma$ for a curve $\bar\gamma\:\SS^1\to X$.


A majorization $\SS^1\xrightarrow{\bar\gamma}X\xrightarrow{s}Y$ of $\gamma$ is called metric minimizing 
if for any other majorization $\SS^1\xrightarrow{\bar\gamma'}X'\xrightarrow{s'}Y$ of $\gamma$
there is no short map $i\:X\to X'$ such that $\gamma'=i\circ\gamma$ which is strictly short on a pair of pints in $X$. 

\begin{thm}{Main theorem}\label{thm:mainintro}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space and $X$ minimizing filling of a closed rectifiable curve $\gamma\:\SS^1\to Y$
and $\SS^1\xrightarrow{\bar\gamma}X\xrightarrow{s}Y$ be its majorization.
Then $X$ is a $\CAT[0]$ space homeomorphic to a disc retract.

Moreover if in addition $\gamma$ is a simple curve, then $X$ is homeomorphic to the disc.
\end{thm}

\section{Finite-whole extension lemma}\label{Finite-whole extension lemma}

\begin{thm}{Finite-whole extension lemma}\label{lem:finite-whole}
Let $X$ and $Y$ be a metric spaces, $A\subset X$ and $f\:A\to Y$ is a short map.
Assume $Y$ is compact and for any finite set $F\subset X$ there is a short map $F\to Y$ which agrees with $f$ in $F\cap A$.
Then there is a short map $X\to Y$ which agrees with $f$ in $A$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Given a finite set $F\subset X$,
denote by $\mathfrak{S}_F$ the set of all short maps $h\: F\to Y$ which agree with $f$ in $F\cap A$.
Given $x\in F$ consider the set
\[K(F,x)=\set{h(x)\in Y}{h\in \mathfrak{S}_F}.\]

By assumption of lemma 
\[K(F,x)\ne\emptyset\eqlbl{Kne0}\] for any finite set $F\subset X$ and $x\in F$.
Further, note that $K(F,x)$ is closed and
\[K(F',x)\supset K(F,x)\eqlbl{KinK}\]
for any other finite set $F'$ such that 
$x\in F'\subset F$.

Without loss of generality we can assume that $A$ (the domain of $f$) is a maximal set with respect to inclusion such that $f$ satisfies the assumptions of the lemma;
that is, we can not add to the domain of $f$ a single point in such a way that the assumptions of the lemma still holds.
(It follows that $A$ is closed subset of $X$, but we will not use it.)

Arguing by contradiction, assume $A\ne X$; fix $x\in X\backslash A$.
Given $y\in Y$ there is a finite set $F\ni x$ such that $y\notin K(F,x)$.
Or equivalently the intersection of all $K(F,x)$ for all finite sets $F$ including $x$ is empty.

By finite intersection property, 
we can choose a finite collection of finite sets $F_1,\dots F_n$ containing $x$ such that 
\[K(F_1,x)\cap \dots\cap K(F_n,x)=\emptyset.\eqlbl{K(F,x)}\]

Since the union $F=F_1\cup\dots\cup F_n$ is finite, \ref{Kne0} and \ref{KinK}
imply
\[K(F_1,x)\cap \dots\cap K(F_n,x)\supset K(F,x)\ne \emptyset\]
which contradicts \ref{K(F,x)}.

\section{Minimizing graphs}\label{Metric minimizing graphs}

Assume $\Gamma$ is a  finite graph and $A$ is a subset of its vertices.
Let $Y\in\CAT[0]$ and $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ be an arbitrary map.
The map $f$ is called \emph{edge minimizing} relative to $A$ if there is no map $f'\:\Gamma\to Y$
such that 
\[\length f\circ\gamma\ge \length f'\circ\gamma\] 
for any path $\gamma\:[0,1]\to\Gamma$ and for some path the inequality is strict. 
We say that $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ is \emph{strictly edge minimizing} if  there is no map $f'\:\Gamma\to Y$ distinct from $f$
such that 
\[\length f\circ\gamma\ge \length f'\circ\gamma\] 
for any path $\gamma\:[0,1]\to\Gamma$.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}\label{prop:metric-min-graph}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space, 
$\Gamma$ a finite  graph and $A$ a subset of its vertices.
Assume $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ is weakly  minimizing relative to $A$.
Then
\begin{itemize}
\item each edge of $\Gamma$ maps to a geodesic
\item for any vertex $v\notin A$ and any $x\ne f(v)$
there is an edge  $[vw]$ in $\Gamma$ such that
$\measuredangle[f(v)\,^{f(w)}_x]\ge \tfrac\pi2$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover, $f$ is strictly??? metric minimizing relative to $A$. 
\end{thm}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{22 mm}
\begin{lpic}[t(-0 mm),b(-0 mm),r(0 mm),l(0 mm)]{pics/not-sufficient(1)}
%\lbl[lb]{12.5,11;$W_0$}}
\end{lpic}
\end{wrapfigure}

As one may see from the diagram,
the two conditions in the proposition do not guarantee that the map $f$ is metric minimizing,
the solid points form the set $A$.

\parit{Proof.}
The first condition should be obvious.

Assume the second condition does not hold at a vertex $v\zz\notin A$;
that is, there is a point $x\in Y$ such that
$\measuredangle[f(v)^{f(w)}_x]< \tfrac\pi2$
for any adjacent vertex $w$.
In this case moving $f(v)$ toward $x$ along $[f(v)x]$ decrease the lengths of all edges adjacent to $v$, a contradiction.

%???HERE IS A COPY OF SEC 10

To prove the last statement, assume there is a map $f'$ distinct from $f$ such that $f|_A=f'|_A$ and $f\succcurlyeq f'$.
Denote by $g(x)$ the midpoint of $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ for any $x\in \Gamma$. 
By comparison $f\succcurlyeq g$.
It follows that the tautological map $\|\Gamma\|_f\to \|\Gamma\|_g$ is an isometry.
The later implies that the distance $|f(v)-g(v)|$ is the same for all the vertices $v$ in $\Gamma$.
Since we have $|f(v)-g(v)|=0$ for any $v\in A$,
we get $f(v)=g(v)$ for any vertex $v$ in $\Gamma$.
Hence $f=f'$, a contradiction.
\qeds

Assume $\Gamma$ is a finite graph embedded in the plane $\RR^2$;
in particular $\Gamma$ is planar.
The complement to the unbounded connected component of $\RR^2\backslash\Gamma$ will be called filling of $\Gamma$;
it will be denoted as $\Fill\Gamma$.

The vertex of $\Gamma$ will be called \emph{boundary vertex}
if it lies in the boundary $\partial_{\RR^2}[\Fill\Gamma]$,
otherwise it will be called \emph{interior vertex}.

\begin{thm}{Corollary}\label{cor:planar-minimizing-graph}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space and
$\Gamma$ an embedded finite graph in $\RR^2$.
Assume $f\:\Gamma\to Y$ is a edge minimizing relative to the boundary vertices. 
Then there is a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract $W$,
a short map $q\:W\to Y$ so that $f$ factorize as
and the maps $\Gamma\xrightarrow{f'} W \xrightarrow{q} Y$.
\end{thm}


\parit{Proof.}
Fix a cycle $\gamma$ in $\|\Gamma\|_f$ which bounds one of the discs in the complement $\RR^2\backslash \|\Gamma\|_f$.
Set $\ell=\length \bar f\circ\gamma$.

By Reshetnyak's majorization theorem, there is a convex polygon $P$ (possibly degenerate) with perimeter $\ell$ which admits 
a short map to $Y$ in such a way that $f\circ\gamma$ is formed by the image of the boundary.
Note that each angle of $P$ is at least as big as 
the angle between the corresponding edges.

Prepare a polygon as above for each disc in the complement of $\Gamma$
and glue these polygons into $\Gamma$ along the natural map.
The obtained space $D$ which is simply connected.
Therefore in order to show that $D$ is $\CAT[0]$,
we need to check that the sum of the angles around each interior vertex in $\|\Gamma\|_f$ is at least $2\cdot\pi$.


Assume the contrary, that is, 
the sum of the angles around a fixed interior vertex $v$ is less than $2\cdot\pi$.
The space of directions $\Sigma_{f(v)}$ is a $\CAT[1]$ space.
The directions of the edges from $v$ have a natural
cyclic order say $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_k$
such that
\[\measuredangle(\xi_1,\xi_2)+\dots+\measuredangle(\xi_k,\xi_1)<2\cdot\pi.\]
By Reshetnyak's majorization theorem,
the closed broken line $\xi_1,\dots,\xi_k$ is majorized by a convex spherical polygon $P$.
Note that $P$ lies in an open hemisphere with the pole  at some point in $P$.
Choose $x\in Y$ so that the direction form $f(v)$ to $x$ coincides with the image of the pole in $\Sigma_{f(v)}$.
This choice of $x$ contradicts the condition in Proposition~\ref{prop:metric-min-graph}.

The short maps from Reshetnyak's majorization theorem fit together to yield the existance of the required short maps.

\section{Key Lemma}\label{Key Lemma}


\begin{thm}{Key Lemma}\label{lem:key}
Let $Y$ be a $\CAT[0]$ space and $X$ 
be a metric minimizing filling of a closed curve $\gamma$.
Given a finite set $F\subset X$ 
there is 
(1) a $\CAT[0]$ space $W$, which is a disc retract,
and (2) short maps $p\:F\to W$ and $q\:W\to Y$ such that
\[\bar s(x)=q\circ p(x)\] 
for any $x\in F\cap \partial |\DD|_s$
and 
\[|p(x)-p(y)|_W\le |x-y|_X\] 
for any $x,y\in F$.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let us connect each pair $x,y$ of points in $F$ by geodesics.

We can assume that 
every pair of the constructed geodesics 
are either disjoint, or their intersection is formed by finite collections of arcs and points.

Indeed, if some number of geodesics $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n$ has this property and we are given points $x$ and $y$, then
we choose a minimizing geodesic $\gamma_{n+1}$ from $x$ to $y$ which maximizes the time it spends in $\gamma_1,\dots,\gamma_n$  in the order of importance.
Namely, 
\begin{itemize}
\item  among all minimizing geodesics connecting $x$ to $y$
choose one which spends maximal time in $\gamma_1$ --- in this case $\gamma_{n+1}$ intesects $\gamma_1$ along the empty set, one-point set or a closed arc.
\item among all minimizing geodesics as above
choose one which spends maximal time in $\gamma_2$ --- in this case $\gamma_{n+1}$ intesects $\gamma_2$ along at most two arcs and points.
\item and so on.
\end{itemize}

%IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT INTERSECTION OF ANY TWO GEODESIC IS EMPTY OR CONNECTED, BUT I FAILED TO MAKE IT FORMALLY???

In particular the set of all these geodesics forms a finite graph, say $\Gamma$,
embedded in $X$. 

According to Proposition~\ref{prop:|D|},
$|\DD|_s$ admits an embedding into the plane.
Therefore $\Gamma$ can be considered as a graph embedded into the plane.
By Proposition~\ref{prop:exist}, there is a map $u\:\Gamma\to Y$ metric minimizing relative to $\Gamma\cap\partial|\DD|_{\bar s}$ with
$\bar s|_\Gamma\succcurlyeq u$.
Hence there is a short map $\alpha\:\|\Gamma\|_{\bar s|_\Gamma}\to\|\Gamma\|_u$. 
By Corollary~\ref{cor:planar-minimizing-graph} there is a $\CAT[0]$ disc retract $W$, a length preserving embedding
$\|\Gamma\|_u\hookrightarrow W$ and a map $\hat u\:W\to Y$ extending $\bar u$. %???why not to say that q= \hat u???
Set $p=\alpha|_F$ and $q=\hat u$.

\section{Compactness of planar CAT[0] spaces}\label{Compactness}

Let $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ be the set of isometry classes of $\CAT[0]$ metrics on a disc retract with rectifiable
boundary curves of length at most $\ell$.


Here is the main statement in this section.

\begin{thm}{Compactness lemma}\label{lem:compact}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is compact in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\end{thm}

It follows immediately from Lemmas \ref{lem:precompact} and \ref{lem:closed} proven below.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:precompact}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is precompact in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\end{thm}

Further $\area K$ denotes the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure of a metric space $K$. 

\parit{Proof.}
Let $K$ be a metric space with metric $d$ and isometry class in $\mathcal {K}_\ell$.
By Reshetnyak's theorem there is a short map from a convex plane figure $F$ with perimeter at most $\ell$ onto $K$.
In particular, $\area K \le \area F \le \tfrac{\ell^2}{4\pi}$.

Fix $\eps>0$. 
Set $m=\lceil 10\cdot\tfrac\ell\eps\rceil$.
Choose $m$ points $y_1,\dots,y_m$ on $\partial K$
which divide $\partial K$ into arcs of equal length.

Consider the maximal set of points $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ such that $d(x_i,x_j)>\eps$ and $d(x_i,y_j)>\eps$.

Note that the set $\{x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_m\}$
forms an $\eps$-net in $(K,d)$.

Further note that the balls $B_i=B_{\eps/2}(x_i)$
do not overlap.
By comparison,
\[\area B_i\ge \tfrac{\pi\cdot\eps^2}{4}.\]

It follows that $n\le \tfrac{1}{\pi^2}\cdot\left(\tfrac\ell\eps\right)^2$.
That is, there is a integer valued function $N(\eps)$,
such that for  
$(K,d)$ contains an $\eps$-net
with at most $N(\eps)$ points.

In other words, $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is uniformly totally bounded.
Any class of metrics with this property is precompact in Gromov--Hausdorff topology; 
see for example \cite[7.4.15]{BBI}.
\qeds





\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:closed}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is closed in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $(X_n)$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ with $X_n\to X_\infty$. 
Set $r_n=\frac{\length\partial X_n}{2\pi}$ 
and $B_n=B_{r_n}(0)\subset \mathbb{R}^2$.
Let $\gamma_n:\partial B_n\to\partial X_\infty$ be an arc length parametrization.
Choose a point $p_n\in X_n$ with $X_n\subset B_{r_n}(p_n)$ and define
$f_n:B_n\to X_n$ by sending the geodesic $[0\theta]$ for $\theta\in\partial B_n$ to the geodesic $[p_n\gamma_n(\theta)]$ with constant speed. 
Note that $f_n$ is short.
We obtain a limit map $f_\infty:B_\infty\to X_\infty$ which is short and maps radial geodesics in $B_\infty$ to geodesics in $X_\infty$ joining the limit point $p_\infty$
to a boundary point.
Note that if two points $x$  and $y$ map to the same point $q$ under $f_\infty$, then $q$ is a branch point in $X_\infty$ and there is a path $c$ connecting 
$x$ and $y$ which also maps to $q$. 
In particular, $f^{-1}(q)$ is connected.
On the other hand, since we can lift radial geodesics from $X_\infty$ to $B_\infty$ we see that $X_\infty-f^{-1}(q)$
is connected as well.
As in Proposition~\ref{prop:disc-moore} the claim now follows from Moore's theorem in \cite{moore}.
