\section{Compactness lemma}\label{Compactness}

A sequence of pairs $(X_n,\gamma_n)$, where $X_n$ is a metric space and $\gamma_n\:\SS^1\to X_n$ is a 
closed curve is said to \emph{converge} to $(X_\infty,\gamma_\infty)$ if there is a convergence of $X_n$ to $X_\infty$ 
in the sense of Gromov--Hausdorff for which $\gamma_n$ converges to $\gamma_\infty$ pointwise.

More precisely, we ask the following.
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
	\item There is a metric $\rho$ on the disjoint union 
\[\bm{X}=X_\infty\sqcup X_1\sqcup X_2\dots\]
which restricts to the given metric on each $X_\alpha, \alpha\in\{1,2,\dots,\infty\}$, 
and such that $X_n$ converge to $X_\infty$ in the sense of Hausdorff as subsets in $(\bm{X},\rho)$.
\item  The sequence of compositions $\gamma_n\:\SS^1\to X_n \hookrightarrow\bm{X}$ 
converges to $\gamma_\infty\:\SS^1\zz\to X_\infty \hookrightarrow\bm{X}$ pointwise.
\end{enumerate}
Consider the class $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ of $\CAT(0)$ disc retracts whose marked
boundary curves have Lipschitz constant $\ell$.


\begin{thm}{Compactness lemma}\label{lem:compact}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is compact in the topology described above.
\end{thm}

The lemma follows from the two lemmas below.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:precompact}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is precompact in the topology described above.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $K$ be a metric space with the isometry class in $\mathcal {K}_\ell$.

Denote by $\area A$ the two-dimensional Hausdorff measure of $A\subset K$.
By the Euclidean isoperimetric inequality we have 
\[\area K \le \pi\cdot\ell^2.\]

Fix $\eps>0$. 
Set $m=\lceil 10\cdot\tfrac\ell\eps\rceil$.
Choose $m$ points $y_1,\dots,y_m$ on $\partial K$
which divide $\partial K$ into arcs of equal length.

Consider the maximal set of points $\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$ such that $d(x_i,x_j)>\eps$ and $d(x_i,y_j)>\eps$.

Note that the set $\{x_1,\dots,x_n,y_1,\dots,y_m\}$
is an $\eps$-net in $(K,d)$.
Further note that the balls $B_i=B_{\eps/2}(x_i)$
do not overlap.

By comparison,
\[\area B_i\ge \tfrac{\pi\cdot\eps^2}{4}.\]
It follows that $n\le 4\cdot\left(\tfrac\ell\eps\right)^2$.
In particular, there is a integer valued function $N(\eps)$, such that any  
$K$ as above contains an $\eps$-net
with at most $N(\eps)$ points.

The latter means that the class $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is uniformly totally bounded.
By the selection theorem \cite[7.4.15]{BBI}, the class of metrics with this property is precompact in the Gromov--Hausdorff topology.

Since the set of $\ell$-Lipschitz maps defined on $\SS^1$ with compact target is compact 
with respect to pointwise convergence, we conclude that $\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is precompact in the topology defined above.

\begin{thm}{Lemma}\label{lem:closed}
$\mathcal{K}_\ell$ is closed in the topology described above.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Let $(X_n,\gamma_n)$ be a sequence in $\mathcal{K}_\ell$.
Assume $X_n\to X$ and $\gamma_n\to\gamma$. 
Choose a point $o_n\in \partial X_n$ and define
$f_n:\DD\to X_n$ by sending the geodesic $[0,\theta]$ for $\theta\in\partial \DD=\SS^1$ to the geodesic path $[o_n,\gamma_n(\theta)]$ with constant speed. 

By comparison, $f_n$ is a $(5\cdot\ell)$-Lipschitz continuous ruled disc. %??? explain
The limit map $f\:\DD\to X$ is also a $(5\cdot\ell)$-Lipschitz continuous ruled disc. In particular, $f$
is metric minimizing. By Lemma~\ref{prop:point-complement}, $f$ has no bubbles.
Therefore, by Lemma~\ref{prop:disc-moore}, $X$ is a disc retract with boundary curve $\gamma$.
