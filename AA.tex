\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $Y\in\CAT(0)$ 
and 
$f\:\DD\to Y$ be a metric minimizing embedding.
Then $(\DD,\hat\rho_f)\in \CAT(0)$.
\end{thm}



\parit{Proof.}
Let us glue $\RR^2$ to $Y$ along $f$.
We obtain a metrizable space, say $\hat Y$
and the map $f\:\DD\to Y$ admits a natural extension to $\hat f\:\RR^2\to \hat Y$.

According to Proposition~\ref{prop:point-complement}, for any point $y\in \hat Y$ the complement 








Let $A\subset X$ be a closed subset.
A map $f\:X\to Y$ is called metric minimizing rel. $A$
if there is no map $h\:X\to Y$ such that $f\succ h$ and $h(a)=f(a)$ for any $a\in A$.


Let $X$ be a compact connected topological space
and $Y$ be metric spaces.
Given a map $f\:X\to Y$ and two points $x,y\in X$
set 
\[\rho_f(x,y)=\inf\{\diam K\},\]
where infimum is taken for all connected sets $K\subset X$
such that $K\supset x,y$.

Note that $\rho_f$ defines a pseudmetric on $X$;
that is it satifies all the condition for the metric except for $\rho_f(x,y)=0$ does not nesessury implies $x=y$.


Let us consider the equivalence realtion $\sim$ on $X$ 
defined by
$x\sim y$ if and only if $\rho_f(x,y)=0$.
The equivalence class of $x\in X$ with respect to $\sim$
will be denoted by $[x]_f$.
We will denote by $X_f$ 
the metric space of all the equvalence classes with the metric induced by $\rho_f$.

Note that the map $X\to X_f$ defiend as $x\mapsto [x]_f$
is continuous $f$;
in particular $X_f$ is compact.

Consider the induced length metric $\hat\rho_f$ on $X_f$.


Assume $X$ and $Y$ be two metric spaces 
and $f\:T\to M$ is an arbitrary map.

Let us define the intrinsic pullback premetric along $f$.

Fix $\eps>0$.
Given two points $x,y\in X$
set 
\[\ell_\eps(x,y)=\inf\left\{\sum_{i\ge 1}|f(x_i)-f(x_{i-1})|_Y\right\}\]
where the infimum is taken for all $\eps$-chains
$x=x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n=y$.

Set
\[\rho_f(x,y)=\lim_{\eps\to0}\ell_\eps.\]
Note that the function $\eps\mapsto\ell_\eps$ is nonincreasing;
therefore the limit is always defined although might be infinite.

It is straightforward to check that $\rho_f$ is a pseudometric;
that is it satisfies all the axioms of metric except $\rho_f(x,y)=0$ does not nesessury impy $x=y$.
On the other hand, $\rho_f$
defines genuine metric on the quoteint space $X/sim$,
where $x\sim y$ if and ony if $\rho_f(x,y)=0$.
The metric space $(X/\sim,\rho_f)$ will pullback space along $f$
and denoted as $?_f$.

\begin{thm}{Definition}
Let $f\:X\to Y$ be a map between metric spaces
and $A\subset X$.
The map $f$ is called \emph{metric minimizing rel.} $A$
if for any other map $h\: X\to Y$ 
such that $f(a)=h(a)$ for any $A$
the inequality
\[\rho_{h}(x,y)\le \rho_f(x,y)\]
for any pair $x,y\in X$
implies the equality
\[\rho_{h}(x,y)= \rho_f(x,y)\]
for any pair $x,y\in X$.
\end{thm}

For example a minimizing geodesic with any reparametrization is a metric minimizing map fro an interval rel. its ends.

If $X$ is a 2-dimesional disc $\DD$,
we will say that $\DD$ is metric minimizing if it is metric minimizing rel. its boundary

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
For any map $f\:X\to Y$ we have the inequality 
$\rho_f(x,y)\le |f(x)-f(y)|_X$
holds for any pair of points $x,y\in X$.
\end{thm}


\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Assume $f\:X\to Y$ be a continuous map.
Then the pullback pseudometric $\rho_f$ is lowe semicontinuous;
that is
\[\rho_h(x_0,y_0)
\le
\liminf_{|x-x_0|_X,|y-y_0|_X\to 0}
\rho_h(x,y).\]
\end{thm}
