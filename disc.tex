\section{Discs}

Recall that a map between topological spaces is called monotone if the inverse image of any point is connected.

\begin{thm}{Proposition}
Let $f\:\DD\to \DD$ be a light onto map such that for any closed convex set $K\subset \DD$
each connected component of $\DD\backslash f^{-1}K$ intersects the boundary $\partial \DD$.
Assume the restriction $f|_{\partial \DD}$ is a monotone map $\partial\DD\to \partial\DD$.
Then $f$ is monotone.
\end{thm}

\parit{Proof.}
Assume contrary;
that is, there is a point $x\in \DD$ such that the inverse image $f^{-1}\{x\}$ at can be subdivided into two closed sets $A$ and $B$.

Note that $\Theta=\DD\backslash f^{-1}\{x\}=\DD\backslash (A\cup B)$ is connected.
Indeed ...
It follows that $\pi_1\Theta$ contains a free group with two generators.

Consider the set
\[\Omega=\set{(z,s)\in \DD\times\SS^1}{f(z)\not\in [xs]}.\]
Note that $\Omega$ is an open subset of $\DD\times\SS^1$.

The restriction of the projection $\DD\times\SS^1\to \DD$ sends $\Omega$ to $\Theta$.
Note that indunced homomorphism $\pi_1\Omega\to \pi_1\Theta$ is onto.
Indeed, given $z\in \Theta$, we can choose a $s_z\in\SS^1$ such that 
$f(z)\notin [xs_z]$;
moreover the function $z\to s_z$ can be chousen to be contiouous.
In particular for any loop $\lambda\:[0,1]\to\Theta$, the loop 
\[\bar\lambda\:t\mapsto (\lambda(t),s_{\lambda(t)})\]
is a lift of $\lambda$ in $\Omega\subset \DD\times\SS^1$.
It follows that $\pi_1\Omega$ contains a free group with two generators.

The restriction of the projection $\DD\times\SS^1\to \SS^1$ to $\Omega$ has fiber 
$\Phi_s=\DD\backslash f^{-1}[xs]$ at point $s\in\SS^1$.
Clearly $\Phi_s$ is connected and therefore the projection $\Omega\to \SS^1$ induce an isomorphism of fundamental groups.
In particular 
\[\pi_1\Omega=\ZZ,\]
a contradiction. \qeds
